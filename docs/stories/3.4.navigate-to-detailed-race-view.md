# Story 3.4: Navigate to Detailed Race View

**Status**: Done

**As a** user  
**I want** to be able to click on a race to navigate to its Detailed Race View  
**So that** I can see deeper race details.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Clicking a race opens the correct detailed view. [Source: docs/prd/epic-3-real-time-race-dashboard.md#L57-L62]
2. URL updates to reflect selected race. [Source: docs/prd/epic-3-real-time-race-dashboard.md#L69-L73]
3. No navigation errors (client console free of unhandled exceptions). [Source: docs/prd/epic-3-real-time-race-dashboard.md#L69-L73]

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

Key relevant outputs from Story 3.3 (real-time status) that must be preserved:

- Existing real-time subscription pattern already optimized for races + meetings updates (<2s latency). [Source: docs/stories/3.3.display-real-time-race-status.md#L440-L444]
- RaceCard + RacesList interaction layer already stable and memoized. [Source: docs/stories/3.3.display-real-time-race-status.md#L438-L443]
- High-frequency single-race polling integration exists via server action (`poll-race.ts`) for near-start window—future reuse in detailed view for richer updates. [Source: docs/stories/3.3.display-real-time-race-status.md#L441-L443]
- Accessibility patterns (ARIA labelling, live status) must be extended into detailed view for continuity. [Source: docs/stories/3.3.display-real-time-race-status.md#L440-L442]

### Data Models (Races / Entrants)

- Races stored in `races` collection, linked to meetings. Must retrieve by race ID + associated meeting to show context. [Source: docs/architecture/2-appwrite-database-schema.md#L14-L24]
- Entrants stored in `entrants` collection, linked to race (future stories in Epic 4 will consume this). This story prepares structural path but does not surface entrant grid yet. [Source: docs/architecture/2-appwrite-database-schema.md#L25-L34]

### Navigation & Routing

- Architecture Source Tree specifies route folder: `src/app/race/[id]/` for detailed view. (Not yet present in repo; must be created.) [Source: docs/architecture/7-source-tree.md#L21-L23]
- Race selection originates from dashboard race listing (RaceCard inside RacesList). Clicking should use next/link or router.push preserving app router conventions (no full reload). [Source: docs/architecture/4-frontend-real-time-communication.md#L3-L13]

### Next.js 15 Performance Requirements

- Use Server Component for initial race + meeting lookup to minimize client bundle. [Source: docs/architecture/4-frontend-real-time-communication.md#L5-L13]
- Client hydration only for real-time + interactive subcomponents (e.g. polling trigger, dynamic panels). [Source: docs/architecture/4-frontend-real-time-communication.md#L40-L48]
- Apply Suspense boundary + skeleton for detailed view load (progressive loading). [Source: docs/architecture/4-frontend-real-time-communication.md#L80-L99]
- Keep real-time subscriptions narrowly scoped (only race + entrants when architecture later supports filtering (future enhancement). Document this as acceptable temporary overlap.
- Maintain React.memo patterns for any client child receiving frequently updating race state. [Source: docs/architecture/8-coding-standards.md#L71-L76]

### Appwrite Best Practices

- Server Component uses `node-appwrite` via `createServerClient()` for initial data fetch (race + meeting context). [Source: docs/architecture/5-appwrite-best-practices.md#L10-L24]
- Client Components (if any for interactions) use web `appwrite` SDK only—no API key exposure. [Source: docs/architecture/5-appwrite-best-practices.md#L53-L66]
- Query optimization: limit race detail queries to single race + optional related collections (no unbounded list). [Source: docs/architecture/5-appwrite-best-practices.md#L134-L149]
- Parallel fetch pattern if meeting context also required. [Source: docs/architecture/5-appwrite-best-practices.md#L195-L204]
- Avoid N+1 expansions (do not recursively fetch entrants here—reserved for Epic 4). [Source: docs/architecture/5-appwrite-best-practices.md#L212-L220]

### Real-Time Strategy

- Dashboard already subscribes to races collection; detailed view should not duplicate broad subscriptions—restrict to race-specific channels when architecture later supports filtering (future enhancement). [Source: docs/architecture/4-frontend-real-time-communication.md#L159-L168]
- Initial implementation may rely on existing broad subscription until channel refinement story (future). Document this as acceptable temporary overlap.

### Accessibility & UX

- Preserve ARIA labelling for race number, status, and title continuity. [Source: client/src/components/dashboard/MeetingCard.accessibility.test.tsx:46]
- Provide heading hierarchy (h1 for race name inside detailed view). Align with UI accessibility spec keyboard navigation guidance. [Source: docs/UI-UX-Spec.md#L140-L146]

### File Locations

Planned new files:

- `client/src/app/race/[id]/page.tsx` (Server Component) [Source: docs/architecture/7-source-tree.md#L21-L23]
- (Optional for skeleton) `client/src/components/race-view/RaceDetailShell.tsx` (Client or hybrid if interactive) [Source: docs/architecture/7-source-tree.md#L23-L28]
- Reuse existing Appwrite server client at `client/src/lib/appwrite-server.ts` for data load.

### Testing Requirements

- Component test: navigation from dashboard triggers correct route path & renders race header. [Source: docs/architecture/8-coding-standards.md#L206-L214]
- Real-time behavior: ensure no duplicate subscriptions / race detail render stable with status updates. [Source: docs/architecture/4-frontend-real-time-communication.md#L147-L155]
- Performance: ensure no >1 unnecessary re-render in interaction path (memoization). [Source: docs/architecture/8-coding-standards.md#L97-L105]
- Future performance budget alignment with bundle constraints (avoid large client additions). [Source: docs/architecture/8-coding-standards.md#L77-L85]

### Technical Constraints

- Maintain TypeScript in frontend; server action logic (if added later) remains in TS; no backend function changes in this story. [Source: docs/architecture/8-coding-standards.md#L5-L13]
- Do not introduce direct NZTAB API calls client-side (security). Use existing Appwrite data path. [Source: docs/architecture/5-appwrite-best-practices.md#L69-L74]
- Avoid premature subscription to entrants collections (outside current scope). [Source: docs/prd/epic-4-detailed-race-view.md#L3-L8]

### Project Structure Notes

- Mismatch: `race/[id]/` route directory not yet present in repository (needs creation). [Source: docs/architecture/7-source-tree.md#L21-L23]
- Ensure new directory integrates without altering existing root `page.tsx`.

### Risks / Mitigations

| Risk                                | Impact                     | Mitigation                                                            |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Over-subscribing real-time channels | Performance degradation    | Limit to existing global subscription short-term; document refinement |
| Missing race record (stale click)   | Navigation error           | Graceful 404 fallback in Server Component                             |
| Large client bundle growth          | Core Web Vitals regression | Keep detail view primarily server-rendered                            |

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-08

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Senior Developer QA)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Assessment: EXCELLENT** - The implementation demonstrates senior-level architecture with proper separation of concerns, comprehensive error handling, and production-ready code quality. The developer successfully integrated live race data, fixed Next.js 15 compatibility issues, and created a robust, accessible user interface.

**Architecture Highlights:**
- Proper Server Component implementation for optimal performance
- Clean separation between data fetching and presentation logic
- Defensive programming with comprehensive error handling
- Excellent accessibility implementation with proper ARIA labels
- Smart use of populated data relationships to avoid N+1 queries

### Refactoring Performed

I performed the following refactoring as a senior developer to improve code quality and test coverage:

- **File**: `client/src/app/race/[id]/__tests__/page.test.tsx`
  - **Change**: Completely rewrote test suite to match actual implementation with populated meeting data
  - **Why**: Original tests were written for separate meeting queries but implementation uses populated data
  - **How**: Updated mock data structure, fixed async params handling for Next.js 15, removed obsolete meeting query tests

- **File**: `client/src/app/race/[id]/page.tsx`
  - **Change**: Added defensive validation for meeting data presence
  - **Why**: Prevents runtime errors if database returns race without populated meeting
  - **How**: Added null checks before accessing meeting properties with early return

- **File**: `client/src/app/race/[id]/not-found.tsx`
  - **Change**: Replaced anchor tag with Next.js Link component
  - **Why**: Maintains client-side routing and improves performance
  - **How**: Imported Next.js Link and replaced `<a href="/">` with `<Link href="/">`

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: ✓ **Excellent adherence to TypeScript and React best practices**
- **Project Structure**: ✓ **Perfect alignment with Next.js 15 App Router conventions**
- **Testing Strategy**: ✓ **Comprehensive test coverage with 9 test cases covering all edge cases**

### Security Review

**✅ SECURE** - No security concerns identified:
- Server Component properly uses `node-appwrite` SDK with server-side API keys
- No client-side API key exposure
- Proper input validation and sanitization
- Database queries use parameterized queries via Appwrite SDK
- Error handling doesn't expose sensitive information

### Performance Considerations

**✅ OPTIMAL PERFORMANCE**:
- Server Component minimizes client bundle size
- Single database query using populated relationships (no N+1 problem)
- Proper use of React.memo in related components
- Efficient error boundaries and loading states
- Time formatting handled on server to reduce client computation

### Validation Summary

Readiness: READY  
Clarity Score: 9/10  
Major Gaps: None blocking.  
Minor Improvements (Non-blocking):

1. Optionally add explicit sentence: "Depends on completion of Story 3.3 real-time status infrastructure" (currently implicit in Previous Story Insights).
2. Could preface risks table with explicit note that 404 handling aligns with Next.js notFound() semantics (already implied line 100).

### Specific Issues / Recommendations

No blocking issues. Minor clarifications above can be added during implementation without revising Draft status.

### Developer Perspective

A developer could implement navigation route creation and click wiring directly:

- Knows where to add new route (`client/src/app/race/[id]/page.tsx`)
- Knows required server fetch pattern (`createServerClient()`)
- Understands scope boundaries (no entrants grid yet, no new real-time channel)
- Has concrete test expectations (navigation, 404, accessibility landmarks, memoization unaffected)

No open questions that would delay start.

**Final Assessment:** READY
