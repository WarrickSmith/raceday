# Story 2.0: Refactor existing monolithic function to nested Appwrite CLI structure

## Status

Ready for Review

## Story

**As a** developer

**So that** existing progress is preserved while transitioning to the microservices architecture.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. [ ] Existing monolithic function work is successfully migrated to nested structure.
2. [ ] Shared utilities are created for API calls, data parsing, and database operations.
3. [ ] Base nested CLI structure is ready for individual function implementations.
4. [ ] No functional regression from existing working components.
5. [ ] Deployment configuration supports individual function deployment.
6. [ ] All existing timeout protection and error handling is preserved.
7. [ ] Foundation is ready for Stories 2.1 and 2.2 implementation.

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Review existing monolithic `daily-race-importer` implementation (AC: 1, 4)
  - [x] Analyze current main.js functionality and identify reusable components
  - [x] Document existing TAB API integration patterns

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

This is the first story in Epic 2, so no previous story context is available.

### Current Monolithic Implementation Analysis

**Location**: `/server/appwrite/functions/daily-race-importer/`

- **Main Function**: 490 lines implementing complete data pipeline
- **Database Setup**: 586 lines handling all collection management
- **Current Schedule**: 17:00 UTC daily execution
- **Resource Specification**: Standard Appwrite function limits

**Existing TAB API Integration** [Source: architecture/3-backend-services-appwrite-functions.md#existing-implementation]:

- Meetings API fetch with AU/NZ country filtering
- Race Events API with comprehensive entrant data
- 15-second timeout protection on all external API calls
- Proper affiliate credential handling via environment variables
- Rate limiting protection with 1-second delays between races

**Existing Database Operations** [Source: architecture/3-backend-services-appwrite-functions.md#database-operations]:

- Performant upsert pattern (update-first, create-on-404)
- Batch processing in 15-race batches to prevent timeouts
- Comprehensive error isolation - individual failures don't stop entire pipeline
- Relationship management between meetings, races, and entrants collections

**Existing Database Setup Logic** [Source: server/appwrite/functions/daily-race-importer/src/main.js]:

- Database setup called via `ensureDatabaseSetup()` function at start of daily-race-importer
- 60-second timeout protection for database setup operations
- Setup failure doesn't prevent rest of function from continuing
- Complete database schema creation (586 lines in existing database-setup.js)
- All collections and attributes created: meetings, races, entrants, odds-history, money-flow-history, user-alert-configs, notifications

```

**Deployment and Execution Strategy** [Source: current server/appwrite implementation]:

- Each function is self-contained with all required utilities in its `src/` directory
- No shared directory needed since utilities are specific to each function
- Local execution uses scripts/run-function.js with mock Appwrite context
- Remote execution uses Appwrite CLI commands

**Server-Level Package.json Scripts** [Source: current server/appwrite/package.json pattern]:

- `npm run deploy:meetings` - Deploy daily-meetings function
- `npm run deploy:races` - Deploy daily-races function
- `npm run deploy:entrants` - Deploy daily-entrants function
- `npm run deploy:poller` - Deploy race-data-poller function
- `npm run deploy` - Deploy all functions
- `npm run meetings` - Run daily-meetings function locally with mock context
- `npm run races` - Run daily-races function locally with mock context
- `npm run entrants` - Run daily-entrants function locally with mock context
- `npm run poller` - Run race-data-poller function locally with mock context
- `npm run execute` - Show available functions and execution options
- `npm run vars:all` - Update environment variables for all functions

**Database Setup Responsibility**:

- **daily-meetings function** (first scheduled at 17:00 UTC) performs database setup check
- Uses shared `database-setup.js` to ensure all collections and attributes exist
- Creates complete database schema for all functions (meetings, races, entrants, odds-history, money-flow-history, user-alert-configs, notifications)
- 60-second timeout protection with graceful failure handling
- Setup failure doesn't prevent meetings processing from continuing

### Database Schema Requirements

**Collections** [Source: architecture/2-appwrite-database-schema.md]:

- **meetings**: Race meeting information with date, country, raceType indexes
- **races**: Individual race details linked to meetings
- **entrants**: Horse entrants linked to races
- **odds-history**: Historical odds data for entrants
- **money-flow-history**: Money flow tracking for entrants
- **user-alert-configs**: User notification preferences
- **notifications**: Real-time alert notifications

**Relationship Requirements**:

- races → meetings (many-to-one relationship)
- entrants → races (many-to-one relationship)
- odds-history → entrants (many-to-one relationship)
- money-flow-history → entrants (many-to-one relationship)

### API Specifications

**NZ TAB API Endpoints** [Source: architecture/9-dependencies.md]:

- Meetings API: Daily race meetings with country filtering
- Race Events API: Detailed race and entrant data with `with_tote_trends_data=true`
- **No Authentication Required**: Uses HTTP headers for identification (not authentication)
- **Required Headers**:
  - `From: ws@baybox.co.nz`
  - `X-Partner: Warrick Smith`
  - `X-Partner-ID: Private-Developer`
- **Rate Limiting**: 15-second timeouts, 1-second delays between requests

### Technical Constraints

**Language Requirements** [Source: architecture/8-coding-standards.md#backend]:

- JavaScript exclusively for all Appwrite functions (no TypeScript compilation)
- Node.js v22.17.0+ runtime
- Appwrite Node.js SDK v17.0.0+

**Error Handling Requirements** [Source: architecture/8-coding-standards.md#backend]:

- All functions must include robust error handling and logging
- Environment variables for configuration (shared across functions like current implementation)
- Idempotent operations where possible

**Environment Variables Required** [Source: server/appwrite/.env.example]:

- `APPWRITE_ENDPOINT`: Appwrite instance URL
- `APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID`: Project identifier
- `APPWRITE_API_KEY`: API key for function runtime operations
- `NZTAB_API_BASE_URL`: Base URL for NZ TAB API
- Headers configured in code: From, X-Partner, X-Partner-ID values

**Resource Specifications** [Source: architecture/3-backend-services-appwrite-functions.md#function-specifications]:

- daily-meetings: s-1vcpu-512mb, ~60s execution
- daily-races: s-1vcpu-512mb, ~90s execution
- daily-entrants: s-1vcpu-1gb, ~300s execution
- race-data-poller: s-2vcpu-2gb, ~120s execution

### File Locations

**Source File Structure** [Source: Appwrite deployment constraints]:

- **Function utilities**: Self-contained in each `/server/{function-name}/src/` directory
- **Deployment scripts**: In `/server/scripts/` directory for shared deployment logic
- **Import paths**: Functions use relative imports like `import { api } from './api-client.js'`
- **Appwrite path**: Each function's `appwrite.json` path points to its individual directory
- **Local execution**: Uses `scripts/run-function.js` with mock Appwrite context
- **Environment variables**: Shared `.env` file accessible to all functions and scripts

### Testing

**Testing Requirements** [Source: architecture/8-coding-standards.md]:

- **Approach**: Code migration first, basic level testing only
- **Integration Testing Priority**: Focus on actual deployment success verification
- **Shared Utilities Testing**: Test shared utilities independently from individual functions
- **API Compatibility**: Verify API calls work identically to existing implementation with proper headers
- **Database Operations**: Confirm database operations maintain same upsert patterns
- **Deployment Validation**: Integration tests should verify successful deployment of each function
