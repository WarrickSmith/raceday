# Story 3.2: Expand meetings to show races

**Status**: Ready for Review

**As a** user  
**I want** to expand a meeting to see all races within it, showing the race number, race name, and start time  
**So that** I can view race details at a glance.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Races are correctly grouped under their meetings.
2. Race details are shown when a meeting is expanded.
3. UI supports expand/collapse interaction.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

**Story 3.1 Foundation [Source: Story 3.1]:**

- MeetingCard component already created and optimized with React.memo
- MeetingsListClient component handles real-time meeting updates
- Server/Client Component hybrid architecture established
- Real-time subscriptions working for meetings and races collections
- Appwrite dual SDK configuration (node-appwrite server, appwrite client) implemented
- Performance optimizations: loading skeletons, error boundaries, bundle optimization

**Existing Components Available:**

- `client/src/components/dashboard/MeetingCard.tsx` - Base meeting display component
- `client/src/components/dashboard/MeetingsListClient.tsx` - Real-time meetings container
- `client/src/hooks/useRealtimeMeetings.tsx` - Real-time meeting updates hook
- `client/src/server/meetings-data.ts` - Server-side meeting data fetching
- `client/src/types/meetings.ts` - TypeScript interfaces for meeting data

### Data Models

**Races Collection Schema [Source: docs/architecture/2-appwrite-database-schema.md]:**

- Collection ID: `races`
- Fields required for race display:
  - `raceId` (String, required) - primary identifier
  - `raceNumber` (Integer, required) - race sequence in meeting (1, 2, 3...)
  - `raceName` (String, required) - display name
  - `startTime` (DateTime, required) - race start time for display
  - `meeting` (Relationship to Meetings) - linking back to meeting
  - `status` (String, required) - race status (Open, Closed, Running, Finalized)

**Meeting-Race Relationship:**

- One-to-many relationship: Meeting → Races
- Races ordered by `raceNumber` within each meeting
- Race status determines visual styling

### API Specifications

**Appwrite Database Queries [Source: docs/architecture/4-frontend-real-time-communication.md]:**

**Query for Races by Meeting:**

```javascript
// Query races for specific meeting ordered by race number
await databases.listDocuments('raceday-db', 'races', [
  Query.equal('meeting', meetingId),
  Query.orderAsc('raceNumber'),
  Query.limit(20), // Most meetings have <20 races
])
```

**Real-time Subscriptions [Source: docs/architecture/4-frontend-real-time-communication.md]:**

- Already subscribed to `databases.raceday-db.collections.races.documents` in useRealtimeMeetings hook
- Race updates will automatically propagate to expanded meetings
- Handle race status changes with visual indicators

### Component Specifications

### File Locations

**New Files to Create [Source: docs/architecture/7-source-tree.md + Next.js 15 Architecture]:**

- `client/src/components/dashboard/RaceCard.tsx` - Individual race display component
- `client/src/components/dashboard/RacesList.tsx` - Races container component
- `client/src/hooks/useRacesForMeeting.tsx` - Hook for fetching meeting races
- `client/src/services/races.ts` - Race data service functions
- `client/src/types/races.ts` - TypeScript interfaces for race data
- `client/src/components/skeletons/RaceCardSkeleton.tsx` - Loading skeleton for races

**Files to Modify:**

- `client/src/components/dashboard/MeetingCard.tsx` - Add expand/collapse functionality
- `client/src/types/meetings.ts` - Add expanded state to meeting interface

### Next.js 15 Performance Requirements

**Server Component vs Client Component Usage [Source: docs/architecture/4-frontend-real-time-communication.md]:**

- **Server Components**: Continue using for initial meeting data (no changes needed)
- **Client Components**: Race expansion is interactive, requires Client Components
- **Hybrid Pattern**: Expand/collapse state managed in Client Components only

**Appwrite Dual SDK Strategy [Source: docs/architecture/6-tech-stack.md]:**

- **Server SDK** (`node-appwrite`): No additional server-side race fetching needed
- **Client SDK** (`appwrite`): Use for on-demand race fetching when meetings expand
- **Security**: Maintain API key server-side only pattern

**Bundle Optimization and Lazy Loading [Source: docs/architecture/6-tech-stack.md]:**

```typescript
// Lazy load race components only when needed
const RacesList = dynamic(() => import('./RacesList'), {
  loading: () => <RaceCardSkeleton count={5} />,
  ssr: false, // Client-side only for interactive expansion
})

// Tree-shaken imports for race functionality
import { Query } from 'appwrite' // Only import Query, not entire SDK
```

**Performance Targets:**

- Race expansion should load <1s after click
- Bundle size increase <50KB for new race components
- React.memo() optimization for all race components
- Virtualization if meetings have >10 races

### Real-time Subscription Optimization Patterns

**Connection Management [Source: docs/architecture/4-frontend-real-time-communication.md]:**

- Existing useRealtimeMeetings hook already subscribes to races collection
- Race updates automatically flow to expanded meetings
- No additional subscriptions needed (optimization)

**Update Batching:**

```typescript
// Update races within meetings efficiently
const updateRacesInMeetings = useCallback(
  (meetings: Meeting[], raceUpdate: any) => {
    return meetings.map((meeting) => {
      if (meeting.id === raceUpdate.meeting) {
        return {
          ...meeting,
          races: updateRaceInList(meeting.races, raceUpdate),
        }
      }
      return meeting
    })
  },
  []
)
```

### Performance Targets and Caching

**Caching Strategy [Source: docs/architecture/6-tech-stack.md]:**

- Cache races per meeting to avoid re-fetching on expand/collapse
- Use React state for expand/collapse UI state (no server sync needed)
- Implement stale-while-revalidate pattern for race data

**Performance Metrics:**

- Initial race load: <1s after meeting expansion
- Bundle size: <50KB increase for race functionality
- Real-time latency: <2s for race status updates
- Memory usage: Efficient cleanup when meetings collapse

### Testing Requirements

**Testing Strategy [Source: docs/architecture/8-coding-standards.md]:**

**Component Testing:**

- Test MeetingCard expand/collapse functionality
- Test RaceCard displays correct race information
- Test RacesList handles loading and error states
- Test expand state persistence during real-time updates

**Hook Testing:**

- Test useRacesForMeeting fetches correct data
- Mock race API calls and test caching behavior
- Test race updates integrate with existing useRealtimeMeetings

**Integration Testing:**

- Test full expand/collapse workflow
- Test race real-time updates when meetings expanded
- Test performance with multiple expanded meetings

**Specific Test Cases:**

- Meeting expands to show races in correct order (by raceNumber)
- Race status updates reflect in real-time when meeting expanded
- Expand/collapse state maintained during meeting list updates
- Error handling when race data fails to load
- Loading skeletons display during race fetching

### Technical Constraints

**Frontend Standards [Source: docs/architecture/8-coding-standards.md]:**

- **TypeScript exclusively** for all new race components
- **Next.js App Router** patterns maintained
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling with consistent design system
- **Appwrite SDK** client-side only for race data fetching
- **React.memo()** optimization for all new components

**Real-time Requirements [Source: docs/architecture/4-frontend-real-time-communication.md]:**

- Maintain <2s latency for race status updates
- Efficient re-rendering when race data changes
- Handle connection errors gracefully
- Preserve expand/collapse state during real-time updates

**Security Constraints:**

- No additional API keys or server-side changes needed
- Use existing client-side Appwrite configuration
- Validate race data on client-side before display

### UI/UX Requirements

**Expand/Collapse Interaction:**

- Clear expand/collapse indicator (chevron icon)
- Smooth transition animations
- Loading skeleton while races load
- Empty state if meeting has no races

**Race Display Design:**

- Race number prominently displayed
- Race name and start time clearly visible
- Status indicators with appropriate colors
- Responsive design for mobile/desktop
- Hover states for interactive elements

**Accessibility:**

- ARIA expanded/collapsed states
- Keyboard navigation (Enter/Space to expand)
- Screen reader announcements for state changes
- Focus management when expanding/collapsing
- Semantic HTML structure (details/summary pattern consideration)

**Visual Hierarchy:**

- Clear distinction between meeting and race information
- Consistent spacing and typography
- Race cards visually nested under meeting cards
- Status colors following established design system
