# Story 2.2: Implement dynamic polling function

**Status**: Approved

**As the** system  
**I need** to trigger a dynamic polling process for each race based on its start time  
**So that** live data is accurate.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Polling adapts to race schedule with dynamic intervals based on time to start
2. Entrant data is current with latest odds and money flow information
3. No missed updates during critical pre-start and post-start periods

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

Story 2.1 successfully established the foundation for race data management with:

- Project restructured with client/server separation working correctly
- Database collections and schema established with collections: meetings, races, entrants, odds-history, money-flow-history, user-alert-configs, notifications
- NZTAB API integration working with proper authentication and environment variable handling
- Timezone handling for NZ local time implemented correctly for daily imports
- Filtering logic confirmed for AU/NZ Horse/Harness racing only (excludes Greyhounds)
- **JavaScript-only implementation pattern established** for Appwrite functions (no TypeScript compilation)

### Polling Strategy Requirements

**Dynamic Polling Schedule [Source: /home/warrick/Dev/raceday/docs/brief.md]:**

For each race, monitor `advertised_start` time and initiate polling one hour prior:

- **T-60m to T-20m**: Poll every 5 minutes
- **T-20m to T-10m**: Poll every 2 minutes
- **T-10m to T-5m**: Poll every 1 minute
- **T-5m to Start**: Poll every 15 seconds
- **Post-Start to Finalized**: Poll every 5 minutes until results are confirmed

**Critical Implementation Notes:**

- 'T' is the specific race scheduled start time (`advertised_start`)
- Start time may vary due to delays, so actual start status must be polled
- Data polling continues at 15 seconds from scheduled time until start is confirmed
- Race status determines polling continuation (stop when "Final")

### Data Models

**Collections Schema [Source: /home/warrick/Dev/raceday/client/scripts/appwrite-setup.ts#22-31]:**

**Races Collection Fields (for polling queries):**

- `raceId` (String, required) ← primary key for race identification
- `status` (String, required) ← race status for polling decisions
- `startTime` (DateTime, required) ← `advertised_start` for polling schedule calculation
- `meeting` (Relationship to Meetings) ← meeting context

**Entrants Collection Fields (target for updates):**

- `entrantId` (String, required)
- `name` (String, required)
- `runnerNumber` (Integer, required)
- `jockey` (String, optional)
- `trainerName` (String, optional)
- `winOdds` (Float, optional)
- `placeOdds` (Float, optional)
- `isScratched` (Boolean, required)
- `race` (Relationship to Races)

**OddsHistory Collection Fields (for tracking changes):**

- `entrant` (Relationship to Entrants)
- `winOdds` (Float, required)
- `placeOdds` (Float, required)
- `timestamp` (DateTime, required)

**MoneyFlowHistory Collection Fields (for flow tracking):**

- `entrant` (Relationship to Entrants)
- `holdPercentage` (Float, required)
- `timestamp` (DateTime, required)

### API Specifications

**NZTAB API Race Data Endpoints [Source: docs/nztab/NZTAB-API-ENDPOINTS.txt]:**

Primary polling endpoint: `{{baseUrl}}/affiliates/v1/racing/events/:id`

- Fetches detailed race data including entrants, odds, and live information
- Race ID parameter from races collection `raceId` field
- Authentication via headers: From, X-Partner, X-Partner-ID
- Response includes comprehensive race details with runners, odds (fixed and pool), money flow data, and race status

**API Response Structure for Race Events [Source: docs/nztab/Events-For-A-Specified-Race.txt]:**

```json
{
  "race": {
    "event_id": "uuid",
    "status": "Final|Interim|CLOSED|",
    "advertised_start": timestamp,
    "actual_start": timestamp
  },
  "entrants": [{
    "entrant_id": "uuid",
    "name": "Horse Name",
    "runner_number": 1,
    "is_scratched": false,
    "jockey": "Jockey Name",
    "trainer_name": "Trainer Name",
    "odds": {
      "fixed_win": 5.0,
      "fixed_place": 1.8,
      "pool_win": 4.4,
      "pool_place": 1.5
    }
  }],
  "money_flow": {
    "entrant_liabilities": [{
      "entrant_id": "uuid",
      "hold_percentage": 12.5
    }]
  }
}
```

**Race Status Values for Polling Logic:**

- `"Final"` - Race completed, stop polling
- `"Interim"` - Race in progress, continue polling every 5 minutes
- `"CLOSED"` - Betting closed, continue polling based on schedule
- `""` (empty) - Future race, poll based on time-to-start schedule

### Component Specifications

**Appwrite Function Configuration [Source: docs/architecture/3-backend-services-appwrite-functions.md#16-28]:**

- Function name: `race-data-poller`
- Runtime: Node.js (v22.17.0+)
- Trigger: HTTP endpoint (called by external scheduler or webhook system)
- Environment variables: NZTAB API credentials (same as daily-race-importer)
- Timeout: Sufficient for multiple API calls and batch database operations

**Function Dependencies [Source: docs/architecture/6-tech-stack.md#14-15]:**

- Appwrite Node.js SDK (v17.0.0+)
- Node.js fetch API for NZTAB API calls
- Error logging and monitoring

### File Locations

**Project Structure [Source: docs/architecture/7-source-tree.md]:**
Based on successful restructuring from Story 2.1:

```

### Testing Requirements

**Function Testing [Source: docs/architecture/8-coding-standards.md#24-27]:**

- All functions must include robust error handling and logging
- Environment variables must be validated
- Functions should be idempotent where possible
- Test API connectivity and response parsing
- Test database operations for entrants, odds history, and money flow history
- Test polling interval calculations with different time-to-start scenarios

### Technical Constraints

**Backend Standards [Source: docs/architecture/8-coding-standards.md#24-27]:**

- **JavaScript exclusively** for all Appwrite functions (no TypeScript compilation required)
- Error handling and logging mandatory for all functions
- Environment variables for secrets/configuration (never hardcoded)
- Idempotent operations where possible
- All secrets stored as Appwrite Function environment variables

**Database Operations:**

- Use existing database ID: `raceday-db` [Source: /home/warrick/Dev/raceday/scripts/appwrite-setup.ts#21]
- Use existing collection IDs from config [Source: /home/warrick/Dev/raceday/scripts/appwrite-setup.ts#22-30]
- Handle concurrent updates gracefully (multiple polls of same race)
- Maintain referential integrity between races, entrants, odds history, money flow history
- Implement upsert operations for entrant data updates
- Record historical data for odds and money flow changes

**Polling Strategy Constraints:**

- Calculate dynamic intervals based on `advertised_start` time
- Handle delayed starts by continuing 15-second polling until actual start confirmed
- Rate limiting compliance for NZTAB API
- Stop polling when race status becomes "Final"
- Prioritize races nearing start time with more frequent polling

### Testing

**Testing Requirements [Source: docs/architecture/8-coding-standards.md#24-27]:**

- Test files should be located in same directory as function (server/race-data-poller/)
- Use Node.js testing framework (Jest or similar)
- Test polling interval calculations for all time ranges (T-60m to post-start)
- Test API response parsing with sample NZTAB data
- Test database upsert operations for entrants, odds history, money flow
- Test race status handling and polling termination logic
- Test error handling for API failures and database errors
- Test idempotent behavior for repeated polling of same race
- Integration tests for full polling workflow with time-based scenarios
