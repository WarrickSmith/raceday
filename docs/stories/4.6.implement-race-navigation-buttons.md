# Story 4.6: Implement race navigation buttons

**Status**: Done

**As a** user  
**I want** navigation buttons to move to Previous Race, Next Race, and Next Scheduled Race  
**So that** I can quickly scan races.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Navigation buttons work for all races. [Source: docs/prd/epic-4-detailed-race-view.md#L107]
2. Correct race view is displayed after navigation. [Source: docs/prd/epic-4-detailed-race-view.md#L108]
3. Buttons are accessible. [Source: docs/prd/epic-4-detailed-race-view.md#L109]

## Story Context

This story enables **seamless chronological race browsing** across all meetings while preserving the critical historical context needed for market movement analysis. The navigation system will implement **meeting-agnostic chronological navigation** that allows users to flow through races by scheduled start time, maintaining the comprehensive historical data that enables detection of significant market movements and trends.

**Key Requirements Clarification:**
- **Simplified Navigation Strategy**: Two buttons for chronological browsing (Previous Scheduled Race ← | → Next Scheduled Race)
- **Data Preservation Priority**: Maintain all fetched odds/money flow historical data when navigating between races 
- **Market Analysis Focus**: Preserve trends and data variations for continued visualization across race navigation

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

Key architecture established from Stories 4.1-4.5 that must be integrated into the navigation system:

- **Comprehensive Data Fetching**: Server Component at `/race/[id]/page.tsx` already fetches complete historical data ecosystem - 200 money flow history + 500 odds history records per race [Source: docs/stories/4.5.implement-automatic-data-updates.md#L101-L122]
- **Real-time Architecture**: `useRealtimeEntrants` hook successfully maintains historical data arrays and appends new updates [Source: docs/stories/4.5.implement-automatic-data-updates.md#L181-L207]
- **Data Preservation Pattern**: Current implementation loads all historical data from DB on page load, then maintains it via real-time subscriptions [Source: docs/stories/4.5.implement-automatic-data-updates.md#L124-L160]
- **Performance Optimization**: React.memo, useMemo, batched updates already implemented for smooth operation [Source: docs/stories/4.5.implement-automatic-data-updates.md#L22-L40]

### Navigation Data Requirements

**Chronological Race Navigation Strategy:**

- **Previous Scheduled Race Query**: `Query.lessThan('startTime', currentRace.startTime)` + `Query.orderDesc('startTime')` + `Query.limit(1)` to find the immediately previous race by schedule
- **Next Scheduled Race Query**: `Query.greaterThan('startTime', currentRace.startTime)` + `Query.orderAsc('startTime')` + `Query.limit(1)` to find the immediately next race by schedule
- **Meeting-Agnostic**: Navigation spans across all meetings for seamless chronological browsing
- **Server-Side Navigation Data**: Include prev/next race IDs in existing `getComprehensiveRaceData()` function for efficient hydration

### Data Preservation Architecture

**Critical Requirement - Maintain Historical Context:**

The primary challenge is ensuring that when users navigate between races, all the valuable historical data (odds fluctuations, money flow trends) that enables market movement detection is preserved rather than lost on page refresh.

**Solution Strategy:**
- **Client-Side Navigation**: Use Next.js router with client-side navigation to avoid page refresh that clears historical data
- **Subscription Continuity**: Maintain existing real-time subscriptions during navigation transitions
- **State Preservation**: Keep all loaded historical data (odds history arrays, money flow trends) intact during race transitions
- **URL Updates**: Update browser URL while preserving client component state and historical context

### Next.js 15 Performance Requirements

**Server Component Navigation Enhancement:**
- **Navigation Data Integration**: Modify existing `getComprehensiveRaceData()` to include navigation race IDs alongside existing comprehensive data fetching [Source: docs/architecture/6-tech-stack.md#L67-L76]
- **Efficient Query Strategy**: Add two additional lightweight queries for prev/next race IDs without impacting existing historical data fetching performance [Source: docs/architecture/6-tech-stack.md#L77-L83]
- **Caching Strategy**: Navigation data can leverage existing 5-minute revalidation since race structure is static [Source: docs/architecture/6-tech-stack.md#L25-L27]

**Client Component Navigation Architecture:**
- **Router Integration**: Use Next.js router `push()` method for client-side navigation that preserves component state [Source: docs/architecture/4-frontend-real-time-communication.md#L46-L56]
- **State Management**: Maintain existing real-time subscription architecture during navigation transitions [Source: docs/architecture/4-frontend-real-time-communication.md#L70-L75]
- **Performance Optimization**: Continue existing React.memo(), useMemo() patterns for navigation component [Source: docs/architecture/8-coding-standards.md#L97-L105]

### Appwrite Best Practices

**Server-Side Navigation Queries:**
- **Efficient Query Design**: Navigation queries use indexed fields (`startTime`) with proper ordering and limits [Source: docs/architecture/5-appwrite-best-practices.md#L67-L85]
- **Batch Integration**: Add navigation queries to existing parallel Promise.all() pattern to minimize database round trips [Source: docs/architecture/5-appwrite-best-practices.md#L86-L101]
- **SDK Usage**: Continue using `node-appwrite` in Server Component for navigation data fetching [Source: docs/architecture/5-appwrite-best-practices.md#L15-L28]

**Client-Side Navigation Implementation:**
- **Connection Preservation**: Maintain existing real-time subscriptions during navigation to preserve historical data context [Source: docs/architecture/5-appwrite-best-practices.md#L202-L220]
- **Performance Optimization**: Use existing subscription batching and update optimization patterns [Source: docs/architecture/5-appwrite-best-practices.md#L136-L165]
- **Error Handling**: Implement navigation-specific error handling with graceful fallbacks [Source: docs/architecture/5-appwrite-best-practices.md#L284-L305]

### Database Schema Integration

**Navigation Query Requirements:**
- **Races Collection**: Use existing `startTime` field (already indexed) for chronological navigation queries [Source: docs/architecture/2-appwrite-database-schema.md#L15-L21]
- **Meeting-Independent**: Navigation queries span all meetings using race `startTime` ordering rather than meeting-specific constraints
- **Efficient Indexing**: Leverage existing database indexes on `startTime` field for optimal navigation query performance

### File Locations and Architecture Integration

Based on existing architecture and navigation requirements:

- **Server Component**: Modify existing `/race/[id]/page.tsx` to include navigation data alongside comprehensive race data [Source: docs/architecture/7-source-tree.md#L15-L16]
- **Navigation Component**: Create new `client/src/components/race-view/RaceNavigation.tsx` for client-side navigation functionality [Source: docs/architecture/7-source-tree.md#L18-L19]
- **Header Integration**: Modify existing `client/src/components/race-view/RaceHeader.tsx` to integrate navigation buttons seamlessly [Source: docs/stories/4.1.display-detailed-race-header.md]
- **Type Definitions**: Extend existing `client/src/types/meetings.ts` with navigation data interfaces [Source: docs/architecture/7-source-tree.md#L18]
- **Hook Continuity**: Existing `client/src/hooks/useRealtimeEntrants.ts` continues operating during navigation to preserve historical data

### Testing Requirements

**Navigation Functionality Testing:**
- **Chronological Navigation**: Test previous/next race navigation across multiple meetings and time boundaries [Source: docs/architecture/8-coding-standards.md#L206-L214]
- **Data Preservation**: Verify historical data (odds history, money flow trends) remains intact during navigation [Source: docs/architecture/8-coding-standards.md#L214-L224]

- **Real-time Continuity**: Verify real-time subscriptions continue operating during navigation transitions
- **Performance**: Test navigation speed and confirm client-side routing preserves performance targets

**Accessibility Testing:**
