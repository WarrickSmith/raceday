# Story 4.4: Display odds history sparkline

**Status**: Done

**As a** user  
**I want** to see a sparkline visualization in each row that charts the recent history of the Win odds  
**So that** I can spot trends quickly.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Sparkline chart appears for every entrant. [Source: docs/prd/epic-4-detailed-race-view.md#L71]
2. Data matches odds history. [Source: docs/prd/epic-4-detailed-race-view.md#L72]
3. Charts update in real-time. [Source: docs/prd/epic-4-detailed-race-view.md#L73]

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

Key relevant outputs from Stories 4.2 (create entrants data grid) and 4.3 (display money flow column) that must be preserved and extended:

- EntrantsGrid component already established in `client/src/components/race-view/EntrantsGrid.tsx` [Source: docs/stories/4.3.display-money-flow-column.md#L21]
- Server-side data fetching pattern using `createServerClient()` successfully implemented [Source: docs/stories/4.3.display-money-flow-column.md#L22-L23]
- Real-time subscription architecture with `useRealtimeEntrants` custom hook established [Source: docs/stories/4.3.display-money-flow-column.md#L23]
- Performance optimization patterns (React.memo, useMemo) proven and implemented [Source: docs/stories/4.3.display-money-flow-column.md#L24-L25]
- TypeScript interfaces for Entrant data model defined in `client/src/types/meetings.ts` [Source: docs/stories/4.3.display-money-flow-column.md#L25]
- Accessibility patterns (ARIA labelling, semantic HTML) established [Source: docs/stories/4.3.display-money-flow-column.md#L26-L27]
- Component testing patterns with React Testing Library in place [Source: docs/stories/4.3.display-money-flow-column.md#L27-L28]
- Money Flow column implementation shows successful pattern for adding new data columns [Source: docs/stories/4.3.display-money-flow-column.md#L70]

### Data Models

**Odds History Data Schema:**

- Odds history data available via OddsHistory collection in Appwrite Database [Source: docs/architecture/2-appwrite-database-schema.md#L27-L35]
- OddsHistory collection linked to Entrant via relationship attribute [Source: docs/architecture/2-appwrite-database-schema.md#L32-L33]
- Historical Win odds data accessible for sparkline chart visualization [Source: docs/prd/epic-4-detailed-race-view.md#L60]
- Real-time odds history updates accessible via OddsHistory collection subscription [Source: docs/architecture/4-frontend-real-time-communication.md#L173-L175]
- TypeScript interfaces may need extension in `client/src/types/meetings.ts` to include odds history arrays for sparkline data

### Next.js 15 Performance Requirements

**Server Component Strategy:**

- Server Component in `/race/[id]/page.tsx` should extend existing entrants data fetching to include odds history data via `createServerClient()` [Source: docs/architecture/4-frontend-real-time-communication.md#L10-L26]
- Use `node-appwrite` SDK for server-side odds history data fetching to minimize client bundle [Source: docs/architecture/6-tech-stack.md#L49]
- Pass initial odds history data to Client Component via props for hydration [Source: docs/architecture/8-coding-standards.md#L56-L62]

**Client Component Optimization:**

- Extend existing EntrantsGrid Client Component to include Sparkline column for real-time updates (AC #3) [Source: docs/architecture/4-frontend-real-time-communication.md#L40-L48]
- Preserve existing `React.memo()` optimization on EntrantsGrid component to prevent unnecessary re-renders [Source: docs/architecture/8-coding-standards.md#L71-L76]
- Use `useMemo()` for sparkline data processing and chart calculations within the grid [Source: docs/architecture/8-coding-standards.md#L97-L105]
- Bundle size constraint: keep sparkline library additions minimal to stay under 500KB dashboard target [Source: docs/architecture/6-tech-stack.md#L85]

**Performance Targets:**

- Maintain existing Core Web Vitals performance targets: LCP <2.5s, FID <100ms, CLS <0.1 [Source: docs/architecture/6-tech-stack.md#L77-L79]
- Real-time sparkline updates must propagate to UI within <2 seconds [Source: docs/architecture/6-tech-stack.md#L84]
- Bundle size must remain <500KB for main dashboard page [Source: docs/architecture/6-tech-stack.md#L85]

### Appwrite Best Practices

**Server-Side Data Fetching:**

- Server Component extends existing `createServerClient()` pattern for initial odds history data [Source: docs/architecture/8-coding-standards.md#L167-L182]
- Query optimization: efficient odds history lookup by entrant relationship with appropriate indexing [Source: docs/architecture/4-frontend-real-time-communication.md#L154]
- Limit odds history queries to relevant time window for sparkline display

**Client-Side Real-Time Updates:**

- Extend existing real-time subscription in `useRealtimeEntrants` hook to include odds-history collection [Source: docs/architecture/4-frontend-real-time-communication.md#L170-L175]
- Use optimized subscription patterns to avoid broad subscription overhead [Source: docs/architecture/4-frontend-real-time-communication.md#L147-L151]
- Implement update batching for rapid odds changes to prevent UI thrashing [Source: docs/architecture/4-frontend-real-time-communication.md#L148-L150]

### File Locations

Based on existing structure and architecture requirements:

- Extend existing `client/src/components/race-view/EntrantsGrid.tsx` component to include Sparkline column [Source: docs/architecture/7-source-tree.md#L27]
- Sparkline integration into existing `/race/[id]/page.tsx` Server Component [Source: docs/stories/4.3.display-money-flow-column.md#L71]

### UI Design Requirements

Based on UI spec requirements from enhanced wireframe Screen 1:

- Sparkline chart positioned in Trend column alongside existing trend indicators [Source: docs/UI-UX-Spec.md#L49-L55]
- Small format sparkline showing recent odds movement over time [Source: docs/UI-UX-Spec.md#L13]
- Chart should integrate with existing trend indicators (ðŸ“ˆðŸ“‰) from Money Flow implementation
- Typography: Small format chart that fits within existing table row height [Source: docs/UI-UX-Spec.md#L113-L119]
- Apply 8px grid system for consistent spacing within Trend column [Source: docs/UI-UX-Spec.md#L124]
- Color system: use existing market movement colors - red/pink for shortening odds, blue/purple for lengthening odds [Source: docs/UI-UX-Spec.md#L106-L108]

### Accessibility Requirements

- Maintain existing semantic table structure with proper data cell accessibility for Sparkline column [Source: docs/UI-UX-Spec.md#L147-L152]
- Include ARIA labels for sparkline charts with meaningful descriptions of trend data [Source: docs/UI-UX-Spec.md#L147-L152]
- Ensure sparkline charts have text alternatives for screen readers describing the trend [Source: docs/UI-UX-Spec.md#L152]

- Keyboard navigation support maintained for sparkline column content [Source: docs/UI-UX-Spec.md#L141-L145]

### Technical Constraints

- Must preserve existing TypeScript strict configuration [Source: docs/architecture/8-coding-standards.md#L5-L13]
- Follow established naming conventions: PascalCase for components, camelCase for functions [Source: docs/architecture/8-coding-standards.md#L16-L21]
- No direct NZTAB API calls client-side - use existing Appwrite data path [Source: docs/architecture/8-coding-standards.md#L200-L204]
- Maintain existing error boundary and loading state patterns from Stories 4.1, 4.2, and 4.3 [Source: docs/stories/4.3.display-money-flow-column.md#L99]
- Choose lightweight sparkline library or implement minimal SVG-based chart to avoid bundle bloat

### Testing Requirements

Based on established testing strategy:

- Extend existing EntrantsGrid component tests to include Sparkline column display and real-time updates [Source: docs/architecture/8-coding-standards.md#L206-L214]
- Test sparkline chart renders correctly with proper odds history data visualization [Source: docs/architecture/8-coding-standards.md#L214-L224]
