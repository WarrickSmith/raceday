# Story 4.9: Implement Accurate Moneyflow

## Status
Draft

## Story
**As a** race data analyst,  
**I want** to see accurate money flow timeline data in the Enhanced Race Entrants component that displays real-time cumulative and incremental pool amounts for Win/Place pools,  
**so that** I can track betting patterns and market momentum throughout the pre-race period and understand how money flows into different pools over time.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Pool Toggle Functionality:**
   - [ ] Win/Place pool buttons correctly switch the displayed data in timeline grid and Pool/Pool% columns
   - [ ] Quinella button is removed as specified in brief
   - [ ] Default view is Win pool data

2. **Timeline Grid Data Accuracy:**
   - [ ] Timeline columns display incremental money amounts bet since the previous time point (not cumulative totals)
   - [ ] Grid shows data in real-time up to current time (-30m if race starts in 30 minutes)
   - [ ] Future time columns show "-" placeholder when no data exists yet
   - [ ] Data displays correctly for races navigated to before, during, or after finalization

3. **Pool and Pool% Column Accuracy:**
   - [ ] Pool column shows total pool amount for selected pool type (Win/Place) for each entrant
   - [ ] Pool% column shows percentage of total race pool that each entrant represents
   - [ ] Values update correctly when pool toggle buttons are switched

4. **Real-time Data Updates:**
   - [ ] Component subscribes to Appwrite DB changes and reflects updates instantly
   - [ ] Timeline grid updates automatically as new polling data arrives
   - [ ] All money flow displays update without page refresh

5. **Data Structure and Backend:**
   - [ ] Backend Appwrite functions correctly save money flow history data with proper time attribution
   - [ ] Data calculations handle cumulative vs incremental display logic correctly
   - [ ] Historical data is retained and can be displayed for completed races

  - [ ] Verify money-flow-history collection stores incremental and cumulative data
  - [ ] Ensure polling timestamp and time-to-start fields are correctly populated
  - [ ] Test data retention for historical race analysis

- [ ] **Testing and Validation** (AC: 1,2,3,4,5)
  - [ ] Test pool toggle functionality across different race states
  - [ ] Validate timeline grid calculations with known data sets
  - [ ] Test real-time updates during active race polling
  - [ ] Use Playwright MCP server to navigate to race interface and verify Enhanced Race Entrants component behavior
  - [ ] Use Playwright MCP server to test pool toggle switching and data display accuracy
  - [ ] Use Playwright MCP server to verify timeline grid displays correct incremental money flow data

## Dev Notes

### Performance Requirements (Next.js 15)

**Server Component Usage:**
- Enhanced Race Entrants component should be primarily Server Component for initial data fetching
- Use Client Component wrapper only for real-time updates and interactive pool toggles
- Implement proper data hydration pattern with initialData props

**Bundle Optimization:**
- Use dynamic imports for heavy data visualization components if added
- Ensure money flow calculation logic doesn't bloat main bundle
- Implement proper tree-shaking for Appwrite SDK imports

**Real-time Optimization:**
- Batch subscription updates to prevent excessive re-renders
- Use React.memo() for individual timeline cells to optimize grid performance
- Implement useMemo() for expensive money flow calculations

### Appwrite Best Practices

**SDK Configuration:**
- Use node-appwrite in Server Components for initial data fetching
- Use appwrite web SDK only in Client Components for subscriptions
- Implement proper error handling for database queries

**Database Query Optimization:**
- Use indexed queries on money-flow-history with compound indexes (entrant_id, pollingTimestamp)
- Implement proper pagination for large money flow datasets
- Use Query.select() to fetch only required fields

**Real-time Subscription Management:**
- Subscribe to specific entrant money flow changes, not entire collections
- Implement proper cleanup on component unmount
- Use structured channels for different data types (pools, money-flow, odds)
- Use Context7 MCP server to research latest Appwrite real-time subscription patterns and best practices for high-frequency data updates

### Source Tree Context
[Source: architecture/7-source-tree.md]

**Component Location:** src/components/race/EnhancedEntrantsGrid.tsx
**Related Components:**

### Database Schema Context
[Source: architecture/4-database-schema-appwrite.md]

**Primary Collections:**
- money-flow-history: winPoolAmount, placePoolAmount, incrementalAmount, pollingTimestamp, timeToStart, entrant (relationship)
- race-pools: winPoolTotal, placePoolTotal, lastUpdated, race (relationship)
- entrants: winOdds, placeOdds, holdPercentage, race (relationship)

**Key Indexes:** idx_polling_timestamp, idx_entrant_polling (compound), idx_time_to_start

### Testing Requirements

**Component Testing:**
- Test pool toggle state changes and data switching
- Test timeline grid calculations with mock data
- Test real-time subscription behavior with React Testing Library

**Integration Testing:**
- Test end-to-end money flow data pipeline from NZTAB API to UI
- Validate incremental vs cumulative calculations
- Test historical data display for completed races

**Performance Testing:**
- Verify timeline grid rendering performance with large datasets
- Test real-time update performance under high-frequency data changes
- Monitor bundle size impact of money flow features

**MCP Server Testing Strategy:**
- Use Context7 MCP server to research latest Appwrite testing patterns and SDK documentation
- Use Playwright MCP server for comprehensive UI testing:
  - Navigate to race detail pages and verify Enhanced Race Entrants component loads correctly
  - Test pool toggle interactions (Win/Place button switching)
  - Verify timeline grid displays data correctly with proper time column progression
  - Test real-time data updates by monitoring component behavior during data changes
  - Validate money flow calculations display accurately in timeline grid
  - Test responsive behavior and grid performance with large datasets

### Previous Story Context

From Story 4.8 (Performance Optimization): Component architecture has been optimized for real-time updates with proper subscription management and performance monitoring.

From Story 4.5 (Automatic Data Updates): Real-time subscription infrastructure exists but may need enhancement for money flow specific data patterns.

From Story 4.3 (Money Flow Column): Basic money flow display exists but calculations may be incorrect based on current issues identified.
