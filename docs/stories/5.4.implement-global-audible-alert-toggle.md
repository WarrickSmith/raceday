# Story 5.4: Implement Global Audible Alert Toggle

**Status**: Done

## Story

**As a** user  
**I want** to enable/disable a global, audible alert that triggers one minute before the start of any scheduled race starttime, irrespective of where I am in the application, meetings or race pages.  
**so that** I am aware of upcoming races.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Audible Alert Trigger:**

   - [x] Audible alert triggers one minute before each filtered race start time
   - [x] Alert uses the designated race start sound asset
   - [x] Alert does not fire once the race has started or been marked Final

2. **Global Toggle Control:**

   - [x] User can enable or disable the audible alert via the global toggle UI
   - [x] Toggle state persists per user session
   - [x] Toggle state reflects the stored user preference on load

3. **Filter Awareness:**

   - [x] Only races matching the userâ€™s current filters trigger audible alerts
   - [x] Toggle and alerts behave consistently across dashboard and race detail views
   - [x] Audio playback avoids overlaps when multiple races qualify simultaneously

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] **Implement Global Audible Toggle UI** (AC: 2)

  - [x] Replace the placeholder toggle in the Enhanced Entrants header with an accessible, global audio toggle component
  - [x] Apply Tailwind styling that aligns with the alerts interface and adheres to accessible focus states
  - [x] Reflect the persisted toggle state when the race view renders

        `[Source: architecture/6-tech-stack.md#614-ui-and-styling]`

- [x] **Persist Audible Alert Preference** (AC: 2)

  - [x] Extend existing alert configuration persistence to store the global audio toggle preference
  - [x] Ensure user-specific storage continues to leverage Appwrite session-based access control
  - [x] Update types/services to expose helper functions for reading and writing the audio preference

        `[Source: architecture/6-tech-stack.md#615-state-management]`

- [x] **Schedule and Trigger Audio Alerts** (AC: 1, 3)

  - [x] Create a client hook that monitors upcoming race start times (T-1m) using existing real-time race data
  - [x] Gate audio playback by the global toggle state and current dashboard/race filters
  - [x] Prevent duplicate or overlapping playback by debouncing trigger events per raceId

        `[Source: architecture/4-database-schema-appwrite.md#41-core-collections]`

- [x] **Manage Race Start Audio Asset** (AC: 1)

  - [x] Relocate `race_start.mp3` into the Next.js public assets directory for client access
  - [x] Preload or prime the audio element to avoid playback delay when triggered
  - [x] Document asset usage within the alerts configuration codebase for future updates  
        `[Source: architecture/7-source-tree.md#7-source-tree]`

- [x] **Testing & Validation** (AC: 1, 2, 3)
  - [x] Add unit tests for the hook/service logic covering toggle states, filter awareness, and race scheduling
  - [x] Write integration tests that simulate upcoming races and verify audio trigger gating
  - [x] Create manual QA checklist entries for cross-view toggle consistency and audible playback

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

- Story 5.3 established real-time indicator updates inside `EnhancedEntrantsGrid`, confirming existing hooks for timeline data and view context that the audible toggle must respect.
- Story 5.2 delivered the alert calculation service with user preference integration, providing a persistence pattern for alert-related settings that this story should extend.

### Data Models

- **Races collection** stores `startTime`, `status`, and meeting linkage needed to determine when to fire alerts. `[Source: architecture/4-database-schema-appwrite.md#41-core-collections]`
- **User alert configurations** already live in `user-alert-configs` for storing user-specific alert preferences, offering a natural extension point for the audio toggle. `[Source: architecture/4-database-schema-appwrite.md#41-core-collections]`

### API Specifications

- Client interactions with Appwrite use the web SDK within client components, relying on session-based authentication to protect user preferences. `[Source: architecture/6-tech-stack.md#622-appwrite-sdk-strategy]`
- Real-time alert timing should leverage the existing Appwrite subscriptions that stream entrant and race updates for sub-second latency. `[Source: architecture/12-client-integration.md#121-enhanced-real-time-data-architecture]`

### Component Specifications

- `EnhancedEntrantsGrid` and related race-view components reside under `src/components/race-view/`, providing the context for the global toggle UI. `[Source: architecture/3-frontend-architecture-nextjs-15.md#32-enhanced-component-architecture-v47]`
- Hooks for race data and timeline management (e.g., `useMoneyFlowTimeline`, `useUnifiedRaceSubscription`) live in `src/hooks/` and should be reused for scheduling logic. `[Source: architecture/12-client-integration.md#122-money-flow-timeline-integration]`

### File Locations

- Place shared hooks in `src/hooks/` and services in `src/services/` per the source tree structure. `[Source: architecture/7-source-tree.md#7-source-tree]`
- Static assets such as audio files belong in the `public/` directory for Next.js to serve. `[Source: architecture/7-source-tree.md#7-source-tree]`

### Testing Requirements

- Follow the manual testing strategy to validate user-facing audio behavior, cross-view consistency, and performance expectations. `[Source: docs/testing/manual-testing-strategy.md#overview]`
- Maintain performance targets for real-time responsiveness (<2s) when triggering alerts. `[Source: architecture/6-tech-stack.md#642-application-metrics]`

### Technical Constraints

- Ensure client components stay performant by memoizing heavy computations and throttling real-time updates, in line with real-time performance guidance. `[Source: architecture/5-key-architectural-improvements.md#53-real-time-performance]`
- Keep audio trigger logic within established Next.js 15 client component patterns and TypeScript usage. `[Source: architecture/6-tech-stack.md#611-core-framework]`

### Completion Notes

- Added `AudibleAlertProvider` context and global provider wiring so toggle persists and runs across dashboard/race views.
- Implemented `useAudibleRaceAlerts` hook to schedule audio one minute pre-start, respect filters, and avoid overlapping playback.
- Extended alert configuration API/service/types to store `audibleAlertsEnabled`, ensuring fallbacks and validation.
- Updated Enhanced Entrants header UI to consume context, show loading/error states, and maintain focus accessibility.
- Introduced `fetchUpcomingRaces` service and moved audio asset into public tree for Next.js delivery.
- Updated Appwrite database setup script to provision the `audibleAlertsEnabled` attribute for `user-alert-configs`, enabling persistence once redeployed.
- Added user-gesture audio priming so browsers permit playback immediately after enabling alerts.
- Cancelled gesture-priming playback before scheduled alerts fire to avoid AbortError interruptions.

## QA Results
Gate: PASS
Date: 2025-09-20
Reviewer: Quinn (QA)

Summary:
- Verified global audible alert toggle exists in `EnhancedEntrantsGrid` and is wired via `AudibleAlertProvider`.
- Preference persists through `alertConfigService` with `audibleAlertsEnabled` added to `AlertsConfig` end-to-end.
- Scheduling hook `useAudibleRaceAlerts` triggers audio at T-1m, respects filters, and avoids overlap via debouncing and per-race gating.
- Unit tests present for hook and config service. TypeScript error in tests fixed by including `audibleAlertsEnabled` in mocked config.

Checks against Acceptance Criteria:
- AC1 Audible trigger one minute before start and not after start/final: PASS (hook logic + tests).
- AC2 Global toggle enable/disable with persisted state: PASS (context + service + tests).
- AC3 Filter awareness and cross-view consistency; no overlap: PASS (context filter predicate + hook gating).

Notes:
- Could not execute `npx tsc --noEmit` in this environment due to network sandbox. Addressed the reported TS error by updating test mocks; recommend running local `tsc` and full test suite.

Decision: PASS
