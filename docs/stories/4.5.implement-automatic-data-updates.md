# Story 4.5: Implement automatic data updates

**Status**: Ready for Review

**As a** user  
**I want** to see all data in the grid update automatically without a page refresh  
**So that** I always see the latest info.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. No manual refresh needed for updates. [Source: docs/prd/epic-4-detailed-race-view.md#L89]
2. Data latency is below 2 seconds. [Source: docs/prd/epic-4-detailed-race-view.md#L90]
3. No stale data displayed. [Source: docs/prd/epic-4-detailed-race-view.md#L91]

## Story Context

This story enables the **complete detailed race view experience** by ensuring users always see live, up-to-date information without any manual intervention. The four-tier polling architecture provides intelligent, performance-optimized data updates that automatically adapt to race timing:

- **Proactive Data Availability**: When users navigate to any race, data is already fresh due to continuous schedule monitoring and strategic pre-loading
- **Seamless Real-time Experience**: All race details, entrant odds, money flow, and historical data update automatically as conditions change
- **Performance Intelligence**: System automatically chooses optimal polling strategy (batch vs individual) based on race timing and quantity for maximum efficiency
- **Complete Data Ecosystem**: Updates span across all collections (races, entrants, odds-history, money-flow-history) providing comprehensive live information

## Dev Notes

### Backend Four-Tier Polling Architecture

**Comprehensive Polling Strategy** - Optimized architecture using existing and new Appwrite functions with Next.js server action coordination:

#### Tier 1: Baseline Data Maintenance (`race-data-poller`)
- **Type**: Backend Appwrite function with cron schedule
- **Function Specification**: `race-data-poller` with s-2vcpu-2gb running every **5 minutes** (`*/5 * * * *`) [Source: server/appwrite.json#L45]
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive baseline polling for all races within 1-hour window [Source: User clarification]
- **Processing Duration**: Several minutes to update all races in 1-hour window due to API rate limiting [Source: User clarification]
- **Data Updates**: Race status, entrant odds, money flow, scratching status across all active races
- **Frequency**: Sustainable 5-minute intervals for comprehensive data coverage without API abuse

#### Tier 2: NEW - Batch Dynamic Polling (`batch-race-poller`)
- **Type**: Backend Appwrite function, HTTP-triggered via Next.js server actions
- **Function Specification**: NEW function `batch-race-poller` with s-2vcpu-2gb for handling multiple races efficiently [Source: Performance analysis]
- **Purpose**: Process 3-5 races entering 5-minute window with optimized resource utilization [Source: User performance suggestion]
- **Processing Duration**: 15-30 seconds for batch of races (more efficient than multiple single-race calls)
- **Performance Benefits**: 
  - Single function execution overhead vs multiple HTTP requests
  - Coordinated API rate limiting to NZ TAB 
  - Optimized database connections and transactions
  - Better resource utilization than multiple `single-race-poller` calls
- **Trigger Strategy**: Called by Next.js server action when schedule analysis detects 3+ races entering critical window

#### Tier 3: Individual Dynamic Polling (`single-race-poller`)
- **Type**: Backend Appwrite function, HTTP-triggered via Next.js server actions
- **Function Specification**: Existing `single-race-poller` with s-1vcpu-1gb, HTTP-triggered, no scheduled execution [Source: server/single-race-poller/README.md#L11-L15]
- **Purpose**: Fast individual race updates for races starting within 1 minute where speed is critical [Source: User timing clarification]
- **Processing Duration**: 2-5 seconds per race (maximum speed for immediate needs) [Source: server/single-race-poller/README.md#L172]
- **Use Case**: Races requiring immediate updates when batch processing would be too slow
- **Target Frequency**: 15-second intervals during final minute before race start

#### Tier 4: Schedule Coordination (Next.js Server Actions)
- **Type**: Frontend server-side functions running on Next.js server (NOT Appwrite functions)
- **Purpose**: Continuous schedule monitoring and intelligent polling strategy coordination [Source: Architectural clarification]
- **Schedule Analysis Logic**:
  - Monitor race schedule continuously from client application load
  - Identify races entering 5-minute window and determine optimal polling strategy
  - Choose between `batch-race-poller` (3+ races) vs `single-race-poller` (1-2 races, < 1 minute)
  - Use Appwrite Functions SDK to trigger appropriate backend function via HTTP
  - Track polling status to avoid duplicate triggers
- **Integration Benefits**: Proactive data availability before user navigation, intelligent resource optimization

**Architectural Clarification**:

- **Backend Appwrite Functions**: `race-data-poller`, `batch-race-poller`, `single-race-poller` run on Appwrite infrastructure
- **Frontend Server Actions**: Next.js server-side functions that coordinate polling and bridge client to Appwrite functions
- **Client Integration**: Real-time subscriptions to database changes from all polling tiers
- **Performance Optimization**: Intelligent strategy selection based on race timing and batch size

### Next.js 15 Performance Requirements
