# Story 4.5: Implement automatic data updates

**Status**: Done

**As a** user  
**I want** to see all data in the grid update automatically without a page refresh  
**So that** I always see the latest info.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. No manual refresh needed for updates. [Source: docs/prd/epic-4-detailed-race-view.md#L89]
2. Data latency is below 2 seconds. [Source: docs/prd/epic-4-detailed-race-view.md#L90]
3. No stale data displayed. [Source: docs/prd/epic-4-detailed-race-view.md#L91]

## Story Context

This story enables the **complete detailed race view experience** by ensuring users always see live, up-to-date information without any manual intervention. The **server-side dynamic polling architecture** provides intelligent, performance-optimized data updates that automatically adapt to race timing without any client coordination:

- **Autonomous Server-Side Polling**: All polling decisions and coordination happen entirely within Appwrite functions, eliminating client-triggered requests
- **Intelligent Dynamic Scheduling**: Master scheduler function runs every 15 seconds analyzing race timing and automatically triggering appropriate polling functions
- **Seamless Real-time Experience**: All race details, entrant odds, money flow, and historical data update automatically as conditions change through database subscriptions
- **Performance Intelligence**: System automatically chooses optimal polling strategy (batch vs individual) based on race timing and quantity for maximum efficiency
- **Complete Data Ecosystem**: Updates span across all collections (races, entrants, odds-history, money-flow-history) providing comprehensive live information
- **Timezone-Aware Scheduling**: Master scheduler respects New Zealand local time and only runs during active racing hours (7:00am to 12:00pm NZST)

### New Server-Side Dynamic Polling Architecture

**Autonomous Appwrite Function Architecture** - Complete server-side polling system with intelligent coordination entirely within Appwrite infrastructure:

#### Tier 1: Master Dynamic Scheduler (`master-race-scheduler`) 
- **Type**: NEW Backend Appwrite function with cron schedule
- **Function Specification**: NEW function `master-race-scheduler` with s-1vcpu-1gb running every **15 seconds** (`*/15 * * * * *`)
- **Purpose**: Central coordinator that analyzes all race schedules and triggers appropriate polling functions automatically
- **Schedule Analysis Logic**:
  - Query all races to identify polling requirements based on time-to-start windows and race status
  - Implement dynamic polling intervals: 
    - **T-60m→T-20m**: Poll every **5 minutes**
    - **T-20m→T-10m**: Poll every **2 minutes**  
    - **T-10m→T-5m**: Poll every **1 minute**
    - **T-5m→Start**: Poll every **15 seconds**
    - **Post-Start (status='Closed')→Interim**: Poll every **30 seconds** until race status becomes 'Interim'
    - **Interim→Finalized**: Poll every **5 minutes** until race status becomes 'Final'
  - Track `last_poll_time` per race to prevent redundant polling
  - Choose optimal function: single-race-poller (1-2 races) vs batch-race-poller (3+ races)
  - Trigger appropriate polling function via Appwrite Functions SDK
- **Timezone Awareness**: Only active during NZ racing hours (7:00am to 12:00pm NZST) to conserve resources
- **Performance Benefits**: Eliminates all client-side coordination, centralized decision making, optimal resource allocation

#### Tier 2: Batch Dynamic Polling (`batch-race-poller`)
- **Type**: Existing Backend Appwrite function, triggered by master scheduler
- **Function Specification**: Existing `batch-race-poller` with s-2vcpu-2gb for handling multiple races efficiently
- **Purpose**: Process 3+ races within same polling window with optimized resource utilization
- **Processing Duration**: 15-30 seconds for batch of races (more efficient than multiple single-race calls)
- **Performance Benefits**: 
  - Single function execution overhead vs multiple HTTP requests
  - Coordinated API rate limiting to NZ TAB 
  - Optimized database connections and transactions
  - Better resource utilization than multiple `single-race-poller` calls
- **Trigger Strategy**: Called by master scheduler when 3+ races need polling in same time window

#### Tier 3: Individual Dynamic Polling (`single-race-poller`)
- **Type**: Existing Backend Appwrite function, triggered by master scheduler
- **Function Specification**: Existing `single-race-poller` with s-1vcpu-1gb, triggered by master scheduler only
- **Purpose**: Fast individual race updates for races requiring immediate attention or when batch processing would be inefficient
- **Processing Duration**: 2-5 seconds per race (maximum speed for immediate needs)
- **Use Case**: 1-2 races needing polling, critical timing windows where speed matters most
- **Trigger Strategy**: Called by master scheduler for individual race scenarios

#### Tier 4: Baseline Data Maintenance (`race-data-poller`)
- **Type**: Existing Backend Appwrite function with reduced cron schedule
- **Function Specification**: Existing `race-data-poller` with s-2vcpu-2gb running every **10 minutes** (`*/10 * * * *`) [Reduced frequency due to dynamic polling coverage]
- **Purpose**: Comprehensive baseline polling for all races as fallback and broad data maintenance
- **Processing Duration**: Several minutes to update all races in 1-hour window due to API rate limiting
- **Data Updates**: Race status, entrant odds, money flow, scratching status across all active races
- **Frequency**: Sustainable 10-minute intervals (increased from 5 minutes) since dynamic polling handles critical timing

**Architecture Benefits**:

- **Completely Autonomous**: No client-side coordination or server actions required
- **Intelligent Resource Usage**: Master scheduler optimizes function selection based on race count and timing
- **Timezone-Aware**: Reduces resource usage during non-racing hours
- **Fail-Safe Design**: Baseline poller provides redundancy if dynamic polling has issues
- **Centralized Logic**: All polling decisions made in one place for easier monitoring and debugging

### Next.js 15 Performance Requirements

**Server Component Data Fetching Simplification:**

- **Multi-Collection Fetching**: Existing Server Component continues to fetch complete race ecosystem - races, entrants, odds-history, money-flow-history via `createServerClient()` [Source: docs/architecture/8-coding-standards.md#L67-L76]
- **Batch Query Optimization**: Use efficient batch queries to minimize database round trips for all related data [Source: docs/architecture/8-coding-standards.md#L77-L83]
- **Caching Strategy**: Implement 5-minute revalidation for stable data, instant revalidation for critical real-time data [Source: docs/architecture/6-tech-stack.md#L25-L27]
- **Simplified Architecture**: No longer requires polling coordination logic since all polling happens autonomously in Appwrite

**Client Component Real-time Architecture:**

- **Comprehensive Subscription Model**: Continue using real-time subscriptions to cover all collections: races, entrants, odds-history, money-flow-history [Source: docs/architecture/4-frontend-real-time-communication.md#L70-L75]
- **Update Batching**: Implement intelligent batching for rapid updates to prevent UI thrashing during high-frequency periods [Source: docs/architecture/4-frontend-real-time-communication.md#L48-L50]
- **Connection Management**: Handle reconnections with exponential backoff, offline/online state detection [Source: docs/architecture/4-frontend-real-time-communication.md#L51-L53]
- **Memory Management**: Proper subscription cleanup and data structure optimization [Source: docs/architecture/8-coding-standards.md#L97-L105]

### Appwrite Best Practices

**Autonomous Server-Side Polling Architecture:**

- **Master Scheduler**: New `master-race-scheduler` function provides centralized coordination with 15-second analysis cycles
- **Function Triggering**: Master scheduler uses Appwrite Functions SDK to trigger `batch-race-poller` or `single-race-poller` based on race analysis
- **Database Schema Extension**: Add `last_poll_time` field to races collection for efficient polling coordination
- **Timezone-Aware Scheduling**: Master scheduler respects NZ racing hours (7:00am-12:00pm NZST) to optimize resource usage

**Client-Side Subscription Optimization:**

- **Selective Subscriptions**: Subscribe only to relevant race and entrant data for current race view to minimize bandwidth [Source: docs/architecture/4-frontend-real-time-communication.md#L47-L51]  
- **Channel Filtering**: Use document-level subscriptions where possible to avoid broad collection subscriptions [Source: docs/architecture/4-frontend-real-time-communication.md#L70-L75]
- **Update Filtering**: Client-side filtering of subscription updates to only process relevant changes for current race [Source: docs/architecture/4-frontend-real-time-communication.md#L76-L82]
- **Passive Data Consumption**: Client simply receives data updates via subscriptions without any polling coordination responsibility

### Database Schema Integration  

**Multi-Collection Real-time Updates:**

- **Races Collection**: Real-time updates for race status, actual start time, track conditions [Source: docs/architecture/2-appwrite-database-schema.md#L15-L21]
  - **Schema Addition**: Add `last_poll_time` field (datetime) to track when each race was last polled by master scheduler
- **Entrants Collection**: Real-time updates for current odds, place odds, money flow, scratching status [Source: docs/architecture/2-appwrite-database-schema.md#L22-L28]  
- **OddsHistory Collection**: New records created by polling functions for sparkline chart updates [Source: docs/architecture/2-appwrite-database-schema.md#L29-L35]
- **MoneyFlowHistory Collection**: Historical money flow changes for trend analysis [Source: docs/architecture/2-appwrite-database-schema.md#L36-L42]

### File Locations and Architecture Integration

Based on existing architecture and new autonomous polling strategy:

- **Server Component**: Existing `/race/[id]/page.tsx` continues with comprehensive data fetching, no polling coordination needed [Source: docs/architecture/7-source-tree.md#L15-L16]
- **Client Component**: Existing `client/src/components/race-view/EntrantsGrid.tsx` continues with real-time subscription architecture [Source: docs/architecture/7-source-tree.md#L18-L19]
- **Real-time Hook**: Existing `client/src/hooks/useRealtimeEntrants.ts` continues handling multi-collection subscriptions [Source: docs/stories/4.4.display-odds-history-sparkline.md#L142]
- **New Master Scheduler**: New `server/master-race-scheduler/` Appwrite function for centralized polling coordination
- **Existing Batch Function**: Existing `server/batch-race-poller/` continues as-is, triggered by master scheduler instead of server actions
- **Existing Individual Function**: Existing `server/single-race-poller/` continues as-is, triggered by master scheduler instead of server actions
- **Server Actions Removal**: Existing polling coordination server actions in `client/src/app/actions/race-polling.ts` become redundant and can be removed
- **Type Definitions**: Existing `client/src/types/meetings.ts` continues to support real-time update interfaces [Source: docs/architecture/7-source-tree.md#L18]

### Performance Targets Integration

**Critical Performance Requirements for Real-time Updates:**

- **Sub-2-Second Latency**: Real-time updates must propagate from backend function to frontend display within 2 seconds [Source: docs/prd/epic-4-detailed-race-view.md#L90]
- **Zero Stale Data**: No outdated information displayed - implement optimistic updates where appropriate [Source: docs/prd/epic-4-detailed-race-view.md#L91]
- **Bundle Size Maintenance**: Keep total bundle size under 500KB despite additional real-time infrastructure [Source: docs/architecture/6-tech-stack.md#L85]
- **Core Web Vitals**: Maintain LCP <2.5s, FID <100ms, CLS <0.1 despite increased real-time activity [Source: docs/architecture/6-tech-stack.md#L77-L79]

### Technical Constraints and Requirements

**Autonomous Server-Side Polling Requirements:**

- **Master Scheduler**: NEW `master-race-scheduler` provides 15-second analysis cycles with intelligent function triggering based on race timing and status
- **Dynamic Polling Intervals**: Granular polling based on race lifecycle:
  - T-60m→T-20m: 5 minutes
  - T-20m→T-10m: 2 minutes  
  - T-10m→T-5m: 1 minute
  - T-5m→Start: 15 seconds
  - Post-Start (Closed)→Interim: 30 seconds
