# Story 1.3: Scaffold Appwrite Cloud project and database

**As a** developer  
**I want** a reproducible script to programmatically configure Appwrite project, database, and collections, including user labels for 'user' and 'admin'  
**So that** setup is automated, repeatable, and ready for role-based routing and admin restriction in the application.

#### Tasks

- Write setup script (`scripts/appwrite-setup.ts` or `.js`) using Appwrite Node.js SDK.
- Script creates database, all required collections, and sets up relationships.
- Script creates user labels for 'user' and 'admin' roles for future role-based routing and admin screen restrictions.
- Script is runnable both manually (`node scripts/appwrite-setup.ts`) and programmatically (via CI/CD).
- Document usage in README.

#### Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Script creates all required Appwrite resources.
- [ ] Script creates user labels 'user' and 'admin'.
- [ ] Script is idempotent (safe to run multiple times).
- [ ] Script usage documented in README.
