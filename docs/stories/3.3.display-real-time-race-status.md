# Story 3.3: Display real-time race status

**Status**: Done

**As a** user  
**I want** to see the status of each race (Open, Closed, Running, Finalized) update in real-time on the dashboard  
**So that** I know which races are active.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Status updates occur in real-time (<2s latency).
2. Status is visually clear and accessible.
3. Status matches backend values.

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

**Story 3.2 Foundation [Source: Story 3.2]:**

- RaceCard component already created with race status display capability
- RacesList component handles races within expanded meetings
- useRacesForMeeting hook established for race data fetching
- Real-time subscription already established in useRealtimeMeetings hook for races collection
- Race status enum and validation already implemented in races service
- Performance optimization with React.memo() and caching already in place

**Existing Components Available:**

- `client/src/components/dashboard/RaceCard.tsx` - Race display component with status field
- `client/src/components/dashboard/RacesList.tsx` - Container for races within meetings
- `client/src/hooks/useRealtimeMeetings.tsx` - Real-time hook already subscribes to races collection
- `client/src/hooks/useRacesForMeeting.tsx` - Race fetching hook with caching
- `client/src/services/races.ts` - Race data service with status validation and color helpers
- `client/src/types/meetings.ts` - TypeScript interfaces including Race interface

### Data Polling Architecture

**Appwrite Functions Data Flow [Source: server/appwrite.json + server functions]:**

- **race-data-poller**: Scheduled every 5 minutes (`*/5 * * * *`) for baseline polling within 1-hour window
- **single-race-poller**: HTTP-triggered function for high-frequency polling of specific races
- **Daily import pipeline**: daily-meetings → daily-races → comprehensive data setup

**Real-time Update Flow:**

1. **NZTAB API** → **Appwrite Functions** (server-side node-appwrite SDK)
2. **Appwrite Database** updates → **Real-time subscriptions** (client-side appwrite web SDK)
3. **Client Components** receive updates via existing `useRealtimeMeetings` hook

**High-Frequency Polling Strategy [Source: server/single-race-poller/src/main.js]:**

- Client can trigger `single-race-poller` function for races approaching start time
- Recommended approach: Next.js Server Actions with Appwrite node.js SDK
- Function updates database → real-time subscriptions notify clients
- No direct API polling from client-side (security and rate limiting)

### Data Models

**Race Status Schema [Source: docs/architecture/2-appwrite-database-schema.md]:**

- Collection ID: `races`
- Status field: `status` (String, required) - race status enum value
- Valid status values: `'Open'`, `'Closed'`, `'Running'`, `'Finalized'`
- Status determines visual styling and user interaction capabilities
- Status updates trigger real-time events via Appwrite subscriptions

**Status Business Logic:**

- **Open**: Betting is available, race hasn't started
- **Closed**: Betting closed, race about to start
- **Running**: Race is currently in progress
- **Finalized**: Race completed, results available

**Race Status Colors [Source: client/src/services/races.ts]:**

- Already implemented `getRaceStatusColor()` function:
  - Open: `text-green-600`
  - Closed: `text-yellow-600`
  - Running: `text-blue-600`
  - Finalized: `text-gray-600`

### API Specifications

**Appwrite Real-time Subscriptions [Source: client/src/hooks/useRealtimeMeetings.tsx]:**

**Subscription Channels Already Established:**

```javascript
// Already subscribed in useRealtimeMeetings hook
const unsubscribe = client.subscribe([
  'databases.raceday-db.collections.meetings.documents',
  'databases.raceday-db.collections.races.documents' // ✅ Status updates via this channel
], async (response) => {
  // Race status updates handled in existing subscription
});
```

**Real-time Event Handling [Source: client/src/hooks/useRealtimeMeetings.tsx]:**

```javascript
// Current race update handling in useRealtimeMeetings
if (events.some(e => e.includes('races.documents'))) {
  const race = payload as Race;
  
  // Update race cache for expanded meetings
  if (events.some(e => e.includes('.update'))) {
    updateRaceInCache(race.meeting, race); // ✅ Already updates race status
  }
}
```

**High-Frequency Polling Trigger [Source: server/single-race-poller/src/main.js]:**

- Next.js Server Action to trigger `single-race-poller` function
- Function accepts `{ raceId: "race-uuid" }` payload
- Returns immediate response, processes updates in background
- Database updates trigger real-time subscriptions to client

**Performance Requirements [Source: docs/architecture/4-frontend-real-time-communication.md]:**

- Real-time latency: <2 seconds for status updates (matches AC #1)
- Update batching during high-frequency status changes
- Efficient re-rendering with React.memo optimization
- Connection retry logic with exponential backoff (already implemented)

### File Locations

**Files to Modify [Source: docs/architecture/7-source-tree.md + Next.js 15 Architecture]:**

- `client/src/components/dashboard/RaceCard.tsx` - Enhanced status visual indicators and accessibility
- `client/src/services/races.ts` - Already has status colors, may need enhanced styling classes
- `client/src/styles/globals.css` - Add comprehensive status indicator styling classes

**Files to Create:**

- `client/src/app/actions/poll-race.ts` - Server Action to trigger single-race-poller function

**No Changes Required:**

- `client/src/hooks/useRealtimeMeetings.tsx` - Already handles race status updates optimally
- Real-time subscription infrastructure already established in Story 3.2
- Service layer already handles status validation and colors

### Next.js 15 Performance Requirements

**Server Component vs Client Component Usage [Source: docs/architecture/4-frontend-real-time-communication.md]:**

- **Server Components**: No changes needed (initial data fetching already optimized)
- **Client Components**: Status updates are real-time interactive, perfect for existing Client Component architecture
- **Hybrid Pattern**: Existing Server/Client hybrid pattern maintains optimal performance

**Appwrite Dual SDK Strategy [Source: docs/architecture/6-tech-stack.md]:**

- **Server SDK** (`node-appwrite`): No additional server-side changes needed
- **Client SDK** (`appwrite`): Already configured for real-time race subscriptions
- **Security**: Existing API key server-side only pattern maintained

**Bundle Optimization and Lazy Loading [Source: docs/architecture/6-tech-stack.md]:**

```typescript
// No additional bundle impact - status styling uses existing CSS
// Real-time updates use existing subscription infrastructure
// Component optimizations already implemented with React.memo()

// Status styling with Tailwind CSS (zero bundle impact)
const statusClasses = {
  Open: 'bg-green-100 text-green-800 border-green-200',
  Closed: 'bg-yellow-100 text-yellow-800 border-yellow-200', 
  Running: 'bg-blue-100 text-blue-800 border-blue-200',
  Finalized: 'bg-gray-100 text-gray-800 border-gray-200'
};
```

**Performance Targets:**

- Real-time status updates: <2s latency (AC requirement)
- No additional bundle size increase (use existing infrastructure)
- React.memo() optimization maintains efficient re-rendering
- Status visual updates render <100ms after data update

### Appwrite Best Practices

**SDK Configuration Patterns [Source: docs/architecture/4-frontend-real-time-communication.md]:**

- **Existing Configuration**: Client SDK already properly configured for real-time subscriptions
- **No Changes Required**: Status updates use existing real-time infrastructure
- **Optimization**: Maintain selective subscription pattern to races collection only

**Database Query Optimization [Source: docs/architecture/4-frontend-real-time-communication.md]:**

- **Existing Queries**: Race data already efficiently fetched and cached
- **Real-time Updates**: Status updates flow through existing subscription channels
- **No Additional Queries**: Status changes received via real-time events, not polling

**Real-time Subscription Management [Source: docs/architecture/4-frontend-real-time-communication.md]:**

```typescript
// Existing optimized subscription pattern
const channels = [
  'databases.raceday-db.collections.races.documents' // Status updates via this channel
];

// Optimized update handling for status changes
const handleRaceUpdate = useCallback((response) => {
  if (response.events.includes('databases.raceday-db.collections.races.documents.*.update')) {
    // Batch status updates during high-frequency periods
    updateRaceStatus(response.payload);
  }
}, []);
```

**Error Handling and Retry Logic [Source: docs/architecture/4-frontend-real-time-communication.md]:**

- **Connection Management**: Existing retry logic with exponential backoff
- **Graceful Degradation**: Status displays cached values during connection issues
- **User Feedback**: Connection status indicators already implemented

**Security and Authentication Patterns [Source: docs/architecture/4-frontend-real-time-communication.md]:**

- **Session Management**: Existing authentication patterns maintained
- **No Additional Security**: Status updates use existing secure subscription channels
- **Client Permissions**: Race status updates visible to all authenticated users
