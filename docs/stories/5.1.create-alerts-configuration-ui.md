# Story 5.1: Create Alerts Configuration UI

**Status**: Draft

## Story

**As a** user,
**I want** to access an "Alerts Configuration" modal or screen from the Detailed Race View,
**so that** I can customize my alerts.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Modal Access:**
   - [ ] Modal opens from race view
   - [ ] User can access alerts configuration from Detailed Race View

2. **Alert Configuration:**
   - [ ] User can configure and save alerts
   - [ ] Alert configuration interface is intuitive and user-friendly

3. **Data Persistence:**
   - [ ] Saved alerts persist for user
   - [ ] User preferences are stored and retrieved correctly

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] **Design Alerts Configuration Modal** (AC: 1, 2)
  - [ ] Create `AlertsConfigModal.tsx` component in `/src/components/alerts/`
  - [ ] Implement modal layout with proper accessibility (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation)
  - [ ] Design alert configuration form UI following Tailwind CSS patterns
  - [ ] Add modal backdrop and close functionality

- [ ] **Link Modal from Detailed Race View** (AC: 1)
  - [ ] Add alerts configuration trigger button to race view interface
  - [ ] Integrate modal trigger with existing `EnhancedEntrantsGrid.tsx` or race header
  - [ ] Implement modal state management and visibility controls
  - [ ] Ensure modal integrates with existing race view layout

- [ ] **Save User Alert Preferences** (AC: 2, 3)
  - [ ] Create `alertConfigService.ts` in `/src/services/` for CRUD operations
  - [ ] Implement user preference storage using Appwrite `user-alert-configs` collection
  - [ ] Add user session validation and preference retrieval
  - [ ] Create alert preference types in `/src/types/alerts.ts`

- [ ] **Testing and Validation** (AC: 1, 2, 3)
  - [ ] Unit test modal component rendering and interaction
  - [ ] Test modal accessibility and keyboard navigation
  - [ ] Test preference save/load functionality
  - [ ] Integration test for race view modal trigger

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 4.9: Enhanced Race Interface architecture provides foundation for modal integration. The `EnhancedEntrantsGrid.tsx` component serves as the primary race view interface where the alerts configuration trigger should be integrated.

### Component Specifications

**Modal Architecture:**
[Source: architecture/3-frontend-architecture-nextjs-15.md#enhanced-component-architecture]

- Create `AlertsConfigModal.tsx` as Client Component for interactivity
- Use React state management for modal visibility and form data
- Implement proper modal accessibility with focus management and ARIA attributes
- Follow existing component patterns from `src/components/race/` directory

**UI Framework Requirements:**
[Source: architecture/6-tech-stack.md#614-ui-and-styling]

- Use Tailwind CSS 4.0+ utility classes for styling
- Implement responsive design with mobile-first approach
- Ensure WCAG 2.1 compliance with semantic HTML
- Use container queries for responsive modal sizing

**Client Component Pattern:**
[Source: architecture/6-tech-stack.md#612-architecture-pattern]

- Modal must be Client Component for user interaction
- Use React hooks for state management (useState, useEffect)
- Implement proper component lifecycle management
- Optimize re-rendering with React.memo() if needed

### Data Models

**Alert Configuration Storage:**
[Source: architecture/4-database-schema-appwrite.md#user-alert-configs]

- Use existing `user-alert-configs` collection
- Fields: `userId`, `alertType`, `threshold`, `enabled`, `entrant` (relationship)
- Implement proper user session validation before saving preferences
- Use Appwrite client SDK for CRUD operations

**Type Definitions:**
[Source: architecture/6-tech-stack.md#615-state-management]

- Create comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for alert configurations
- Define alert type enums for consistency
- Implement proper type safety for threshold values and settings

### File Locations

**Component Structure:**
[Source: architecture/7-source-tree.md]

- **Modal Component:** `src/components/alerts/AlertsConfigModal.tsx`
- **Alert Service:** `src/services/alertConfigService.ts`
- **Type Definitions:** `src/types/alerts.ts`
- **Integration Point:** Modify existing `src/components/race-view/EnhancedEntrantsGrid.tsx` or `src/components/race-view/RaceHeader.tsx`

**Appwrite Integration:**
[Source: architecture/6-tech-stack.md#622-appwrite-sdk-strategy]

- Use `appwrite` web SDK in Client Components for user preference management
- Implement proper error handling for database operations
- Use session-based authentication for user preference access

### Testing Requirements

**Component Testing:**
- Test modal opening/closing functionality
- Test form validation and user input handling
- Test accessibility features (keyboard navigation, ARIA labels)
- Test responsive design across different screen sizes

**Integration Testing:**
- Test modal trigger integration with race view
- Test user preference save/load operations
- Test session validation and error handling
- Test modal behavior within existing race interface layout

**Testing Framework:**
Based on existing project patterns, use Jest and React Testing Library for component testing. Follow existing test file patterns in the codebase.

### Technical Constraints

**Performance Requirements:**
[Source: architecture/6-tech-stack.md#64-performance-targets]

- Modal should load within <100ms of trigger
- Form interactions should have <100ms FID
- Component bundle size should remain minimal for performance
- Implement lazy loading if modal becomes complex

**Browser Compatibility:**
- Support modern browsers with React 19 compatibility
- Ensure modal works with keyboard navigation
- Test modal behavior with different viewport sizes
- Implement proper focus management for accessibility

### Project Structure Notes

No structural conflicts identified. Alert components align with existing `src/components/alerts/` directory structure as defined in frontend architecture. Integration with race view components follows established patterns.
