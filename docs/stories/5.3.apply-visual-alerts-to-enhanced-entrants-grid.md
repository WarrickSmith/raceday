# Story 5.3: Apply Visual Alerts to Enhanced Entrants Grid

**Status**: Approved

## Story

**As a** user,
**I want** to see visual background color indicators on cells in the Enhanced Entrants Grid,
**so that** I can quickly identify significant changes in money flow and odds movements.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Background Colors Display:**
   - [ ] Background colors appear on cells when percentage thresholds are exceeded
   - [ ] Colors match the configured indicator colors from user's alert configuration
   - [ ] Only enabled indicators from configuration are displayed

2. **Real-Time Updates:**
   - [ ] Visual indicators update in real-time as new race data arrives
   - [ ] Indicators correctly switch between money and odds logic based on view selector
   - [ ] No indicators shown for scratched horses

3. **Integration and Performance:**
   - [ ] Alert calculation engine integrates seamlessly with Enhanced Entrants Grid component
   - [ ] Visual updates maintain grid performance standards (<100ms update time)
   - [ ] Indicators respect Win/Place/Odds selector button state for which logic to apply

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights

From Story 5.2: Alert calculation engine is complete with `alertCalculationService.ts`, supporting money percentage calculations (timeframe-specific totals) and win odds shortening detection. The 6-tier threshold system (5-10% → Gray through 50%+ → Magenta) is implemented with proper mathematical accuracy. Integration with Story 5.1's `alertConfigService.ts` for user preferences is established. All functions are optimized for <100ms execution suitable for real-time updates.

From Story 5.1: Alert configuration infrastructure includes `AlertsConfigModal.tsx` and `alertConfigService.ts` with user preference storage in `user-alert-configs` collection. Users can enable/disable specific indicator thresholds through the configuration interface.

### Data Models

**Money Flow History Integration:**
[Source: architecture/4-database-schema-appwrite.md#money-flow-history]

- Use existing `money-flow-history` collection with fields: `entrant`, `raceId`, `holdPercentage`, `betPercentage`, `timeToStart`, `timeInterval`, `eventTimestamp`, `winPoolAmount`, `placePoolAmount`, `incrementalAmount`
- Data accessed via `useMoneyFlowTimeline` hook which provides real-time updates
- Money flow data structured in timeframe buckets for percentage calculations

**User Alert Configuration:**
[Source: architecture/4-database-schema-appwrite.md#user-alert-configs]

- Integration with existing `user-alert-configs` collection: `userId`, `alertType`, `threshold`, `enabled`
- User preferences loaded via `alertConfigService.ts` from Story 5.1
- Only display indicators for thresholds marked as enabled by user

**Enhanced Grid Context:**
[Source: client/src/components/race-view/EnhancedEntrantsGrid.tsx]

- Grid uses `PoolViewState` for Win/Place/Odds view switching
- Real-time data updates through `useMoneyFlowTimeline` and `useRace` context
- Grid optimized with performance tracking via `useRenderTracking` and `useMemoryOptimization`

### Component Specifications

**Enhanced Entrants Grid Architecture:**
[Source: architecture/3-frontend-architecture-nextjs-15.md#enhanced-component-architecture]

- Grid component located at `src/components/race-view/EnhancedEntrantsGrid.tsx`
- Uses React memo patterns with `WinOddsCell` and `PlaceOddsCell` components
- Flash-enabled cells with `useValueFlash` hook for visual feedback
- Sticky column positioning with z-index layering for proper display

**Grid Cell Structure:**
[Source: client/src/components/race-view/EnhancedEntrantsGrid.tsx:23-76]

- Cells use Tailwind CSS classes for styling: `px-2 py-1 whitespace-nowrap text-right border-r`
- Background colors applied via `backgroundColor` style or CSS classes
- Height standardized at 30px for consistent grid appearance
- Scratched entrants show "—" instead of values

**Real-Time Integration Pattern:**
[Source: architecture/3-frontend-architecture-nextjs-15.md#enhanced-race-interface-implementation]

- Use `useMoneyFlowTimeline` hook for money flow data subscription
- Real-time updates trigger grid re-render with new indicator calculations
- Performance optimized with `React.useMemo()` and `useCallback()` patterns

### File Locations

**Primary Integration Files:**
[Source: architecture/7-source-tree.md]

- **Main Component:** `src/components/race-view/EnhancedEntrantsGrid.tsx` (existing, to be modified)
- **Alert Services:** `src/services/alertCalculationService.ts` (existing from Story 5.2)
- **User Config:** `src/services/alertConfigService.ts` (existing from Story 5.1)

**New Utility Files:**
- **Color Mapping:** `src/utils/indicatorColors.ts` - Map indicator results to CSS classes

### Testing Requirements

**Test Framework:**
[Source: CLAUDE.md#testing-strategy]

Based on existing project patterns, use Jest and React Testing Library. Follow existing test patterns in component `__tests__` directories.

**Integration Testing Scenarios:**

**Grid Indicator Integration:**
- Test alert calculation service integration with grid component
- Verify indicators appear only for enabled user thresholds
- Test performance with multiple entrants and real-time data updates
- Validate color mapping accuracy for all 6 indicator ranges

**Real-Time Update Testing:**
- Mock `useMoneyFlowTimeline` hook responses for controlled testing
- Test indicator recalculation when new money flow data arrives
- Verify smooth visual transitions during data updates
- Test pool view switching (Win → Place → Odds) indicator logic

**Edge Case Testing:**
- Test scratched horse handling (no indicators displayed)
- Test missing money flow data graceful degradation
- Test user configuration changes affecting displayed indicators
- Test performance under high-frequency real-time updates

**Visual Regression Testing:**
- Test color application doesn't break existing cell styling
- Verify sticky column positioning remains intact with background colors
- Test grid layout consistency with and without indicators
- Validate accessibility with colored backgrounds

### Technical Constraints

**Performance Requirements:**
[Source: architecture/6-tech-stack.md#performance-targets]

- Indicator calculations must execute within <100ms for real-time grid updates
- Use React.memo and useMemo patterns to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- Batch indicator calculations for all visible entrants efficiently
- Maintain Core Web Vitals compliance with visual updates

**Styling Requirements:**
[Source: architecture/6-tech-stack.md#ui-and-styling]

- Use Tailwind CSS 4.0+ utility classes for background colors
- Maintain responsive design with container queries
- Ensure WCAG 2.1 compliance with proper color contrast ratios
- Support both light and potential dark theme variations

**Real-Time Data Constraints:**
- Handle temporary data unavailability during real-time subscription reconnection
- Prevent indicator flickering during rapid data updates
- Maintain calculation accuracy with high-frequency money flow changes
- Support graceful degradation when alert services are unavailable

### Project Structure Notes

No structural conflicts identified. Alert integration builds on existing Story 5.1 and 5.2 infrastructure. Enhanced Entrants Grid component already has performance optimizations and real-time data integration patterns established. New utility files align with existing `src/utils/` and `src/hooks/` directory structure.
