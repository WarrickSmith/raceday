# 12. Client Integration

## 12.1. Enhanced Real-Time Data Architecture

The RaceDay client application leverages Appwrite's real-time subscriptions to provide live betting market visualization with comprehensive historical trend analysis and money flow timeline tracking.

**Key Integration Features:**
- **Unified real-time subscriptions** to `entrants` collection with intelligent filtering
- **Enhanced historical data queries** to `odds-history` and `money-flow-history` collections
- **Race status-based subscription management** with automatic lifecycle control
- **Server-heavy architecture** with pre-calculated incremental amounts
- **Sub-second latency** for market movements and money flow changes
- **Seamless race switching** with preserved historical context and cached data

**Enhanced Subscription Patterns:**
- **Race Status Awareness:** Disable subscriptions for completed races to preserve final state
- **Debounced Updates:** 500ms delays to handle rapid data changes without UI thrashing
- **Unified Channels:** Single subscription with intelligent entrant filtering
- **Error Handling:** Comprehensive try/catch blocks with graceful degradation
- **Performance Optimization:** Client-side caching with race completion awareness

## 12.2. Money Flow Timeline Integration

**Real-Time Money Flow Data:**
- **Live timeline updates** via `money-flow-history` collection subscriptions
- **Pre-calculated incremental amounts** from server-side processing
- **Timeline column generation** with fixed pre-start and dynamic post-start intervals
- **Value flash animations** for changed amounts using `useValueFlash` hook

**Enhanced React Hooks:**
- `useMoneyFlowTimeline` - Unified money flow data with real-time subscriptions
- `useValueFlash` - Value change animation handling
- `useRaceSubscription` - Race status-aware subscription management
- `useUnifiedRaceSubscription` - Single subscription with intelligent filtering
