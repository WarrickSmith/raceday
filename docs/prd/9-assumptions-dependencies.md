- NZ TAB API (`openapi.json`) is stable, provides necessary data for filtering (Country, Race Type), and its data structures remain consistent.
- Appwrite's real-time subscription service can handle required volume of updates for all concurrent users.
- UI design inspired by reference image is desired direction, with added filter controls.
