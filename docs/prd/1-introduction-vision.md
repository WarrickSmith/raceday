# 1. Introduction & Vision

## 1.1. Vision

To provide horse racing enthusiasts with a powerful, real-time data visualization tool that uncovers market insights by tracking odds and money flow dynamics, enabling them to spot significant trends faster and more effectively than any other tool on the market.

## 1.2. Problem Statement

Monitoring horse racing market data is a fragmented and manual process. Bettors and enthusiasts lack a unified, real-time view of how odds and pool money are fluctuating across multiple races and jurisdictions. They cannot easily detect sudden, significant shifts that might indicate market opportunities or insider knowledge, forcing them to rely on less timely data or cumbersome manual checks.

## 1.3. Target Audience & Personas

- **Primary Persona:** The Data-Driven Enthusiast ("Alex")
  - **Description:** Alex is a semi-professional bettor or a serious racing enthusiast who believes that market data holds the key to smarter decisions. They are tech-savvy, analytical, and comfortable interpreting charts and data grids.
  - **Goals:** To identify horses with significant, unusual betting patterns (e.g., a last-minute surge in money, a dramatic odds drop). To monitor multiple races simultaneously without missing a beat, and to focus only on the races that matter to them.
  - **Frustrations:** Existing platforms are slow, require manual refreshing, and don't offer configurable alerts on the specific metrics Alex cares about. It's hard to filter out the noise from races in countries or of types they don't follow.
