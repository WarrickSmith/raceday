Objective: Fix the Race Page, Enhanced Race Entrants, Money Flow Timeline component so it displays Entrant (Runner) information correctly for each race over time. Ensure that the data is persistent and can be reviewed at any time before,  during and after the race finishes and if the race is navigated away from and back to.

Items to be verified and fixed:

Task 1.
- Ensure the Money Flow Timeline columns always display the column header values of 60m, 55m, 50m, 45m, 40m, 35m, 30m, 25m, 20m, 15m, 10m, 5m, 4m, 3m, 2m, 1m, 30s, 0. Where these values represent the fixed time periods in minutes and seconds before a scheduled race start.

- Ensure that if a race does not start at 0s (it's scheduled start time), then additional timeline columns are inserted to the right of '0s' every 30 seconds until the race status changes from 'Open' to any other value like, Closed, Interim, Final or Abandoned.   

- Ensure there is horizontal an vertical scrolling for the timelin columns and that the columns to the left of the 60m column are sticky along with the Pool and Pool% columns on the right of the timeline.

- There should be a visual indicator of the current time relative to the moneyflow timeline columns that highlights the current active column relative to the schduled race start time.

- Currently musch of the above tasks are implemented, except for an active race withint 60m of it's scheduled start time, te timeline columns up to the current actine column are disappearing and the active column is not correctly highlighted (background color change).

Task 2: Display accurate wager (moneyflow) data in the appropriate row and column for each entrant (runner) for any given race timeline period, before, during and after a race.
