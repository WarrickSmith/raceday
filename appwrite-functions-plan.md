- Create `package.json` with node-appwrite dependency
- Create `.env` file template

### 3.2 Extract Database Setup from daily-meetings
- Move `/home/warrick/Dev/raceday/server/daily-meetings/src/database-setup.js` to `/home/warrick/Dev/raceday/server/database-setup/src/database-setup.js`
- Update `daily-meetings/src/main.js` to remove all database setup logic and `ensureDatabaseSetup` call
- Update imports in daily-meetings to remove database-setup dependency

### 3.3 Add Database Setup Configuration
Add new function configuration to `appwrite.json`:
```json
{
    "$id": "database-setup",
    "name": "Database Setup and Schema Management",
    "runtime": "node-22",
    "specification": "s-2vcpu-2gb",
    "path": "database-setup",
    "execute": ["any"],
    "events": [],
    "schedule": "",
    "timeout": 300,
    "enabled": true,
    "logging": true,
    "entrypoint": "src/main.js",

    "scopes": [
        "databases.read",
        "databases.write",
        "collections.read",
        "collections.write",
        "attributes.read",
        "attributes.write",
        "indexes.read",
        "indexes.write"
    ]
}
```

### 3.4 Add Package.json Scripts
Add to package.json:
- `"deploy:database-setup": "node scripts/deploy.js database-setup"`
- `"database-setup": "node scripts/run-function.js database-setup"`

## Task 4: Optimize Database Setup for Robustness

### 4.1 Enhanced Error Handling and Retry Logic
- Implement exponential backoff for attribute creation failures
- Add comprehensive validation for each collection and attribute creation
- Include detailed logging for troubleshooting setup issues

## Task 5: Individual Function Robustness Review

### 5.1 daily-initial-data Function Enhancement
**Current Issues**: Scheduled at 20:30 with 840s timeout, could run until 20:44
**Appwrite Timeout Protection**: Appwrite server enforces 14-minute termination, preventing next-day overlap
**Improvements**:
- Add execution lock mechanism using Appwrite database document as semaphore
- Implement 1:00 AM NZ time auto-termination with cleanup (backup to Appwrite timeout)
- Add graceful shutdown handling for long-running operations
- Implement progress checkpointing for resumable execution
- Add memory usage monitoring and cleanup

### 5.2 daily-meetings Function Enhancement
**Current Issues**: Scheduled at 19:00 with 840s timeout, database setup dependency
**Appwrite Timeout Protection**: Appwrite server enforces 14-minute termination, preventing overlap with daily-races (20:00)
**Improvements**:
- Remove database setup logic (moved to separate function)
- Add execution lock to prevent concurrent runs
- Implement 1:00 AM NZ time termination (backup to Appwrite timeout)
- Add comprehensive API failure handling with exponential backoff
- Optimize memory usage for large meeting datasets

### 5.3 daily-races Function Enhancement
**Current Issues**: Scheduled at 20:00 with 840s timeout, long execution times
**Appwrite Timeout Protection**: Appwrite server enforces 14-minute termination, preventing overlap with next day
**Improvements**:
- Add execution lock mechanism
- Implement chunked processing for large race datasets
- Add 1:00 AM NZ time termination with state persistence (backup to Appwrite timeout)
- Optimize database batch operations
- Add progress tracking and resumable processing

### 5.4 enhanced-race-poller Function Enhancement
**Current Issues**: Complex polling logic, potential overlaps
**Improvements**:
- Add robust execution lock with race-specific granularity
- Implement dynamic timeout based on polling interval requirements
- Add 1:00 AM NZ time termination for continuous polling
- Optimize batch processing algorithms
- Add intelligent race selection logic to prevent redundant polling

### 5.5 master-race-scheduler Function Enhancement
**Current Issues**: Continuous 1-minute schedule creates potential overlapping executions across midnight boundary
**Critical CRON Schedule Issue**: Function executes every minute (`*/1 * * * *`) with 120s timeout. Risk of overlapping executions particularly at midnight when new day's schedule begins.
**Improvements**:
- Add strict execution lock to prevent overlapping scheduler instances (lock expires at 90 seconds maximum to stay within Appwrite 14-minute termination limit)
- Implement midnight boundary awareness with explicit checks for day rollover
- Add self-termination at 1:00 AM NZ time with cleanup
- Add intelligent scheduling logic to prevent function overload
- Optimize race selection algorithms for performance
- Add execution monitoring and automatic backoff on system overload

### 5.6 meeting-status-poller Function Enhancement
**Current Issues**: 15-minute intervals spanning midnight boundary create potential overlaps
**Critical CRON Schedule Issue**: Function schedule `*/15 21-23,0-11 * * *` spans midnight (23:45 PM to 00:00 AM executions). With 300s timeout, executions could overlap across day boundary.
**Improvements**:
- Add execution lock mechanism (expires at 270 seconds maximum to account for Appwrite timeout)
- Implement midnight boundary logic to handle day transitions gracefully
- Add 1:00 AM NZ time termination
- Add intelligent meeting selection to avoid unnecessary polling
- Optimize API call batching for multiple meetings
- Add graceful degradation on API failures

## Task 6: Implement Appwrite 2025 Best Practices

### 6.1 Execution Management Best Practices
- **Single Responsibility**: Ensure each function has one clear purpose
- **Resource Optimization**: Use appropriate CPU/memory specifications for each function
- **Cold Start Optimization**: Implement connection pooling and pre-initialization
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Leverage Appwrite real-time events where appropriate

### 6.2 Execution Lock Implementation
Create shared execution lock utility with Appwrite timeout awareness:
- Use Appwrite database documents as distributed locks
- Implement automatic lock expiration accounting for Appwrite's 14-minute force termination:
  - Master scheduler: 90 seconds maximum (well under 120s timeout)
  - Meeting status poller: 270 seconds maximum (well under 300s timeout)
  - Daily functions: 780 seconds maximum (well under 840s timeout)
- Add heartbeat mechanism for long-running functions
- Include lock cleanup on function termination
- Add midnight boundary checks for CRON functions spanning day transitions

### 6.3 Auto-Termination Implementation
Add NZ timezone-aware termination:
- Check current NZ time on each major operation
- Implement graceful shutdown with cleanup when >= 1:00 AM
- Add state persistence for resumable operations
- Include execution summary logging before termination

### 6.4 Performance Monitoring
- Add execution time tracking and logging
- Implement memory usage monitoring
- Add API call rate limiting awareness
- Include performance alerts for degraded functions

### 6.5 Error Handling and Resilience
- Implement comprehensive error categorization (retryable vs fatal)
- Add exponential backoff for API failures
- Include circuit breaker pattern for external API calls
- Add structured logging for troubleshooting

## Task 7: Update Deployment and Management Scripts

### 7.1 Update Deployment Scripts
- Modify deployment scripts to handle new database-setup function
- Remove references to deleted functions from all deployment utilities
- Add validation to prevent deployment of non-existent functions

### 7.2 Add Function Health Monitoring
- Create monitoring script to check function execution status
- Add alerting for functions that exceed expected execution times
- Implement automatic recovery procedures for stuck functions

## Task 8: Address Critical CRON Schedule Overlap Issues

### 8.1 Master Race Scheduler Overlap Prevention
**Critical Issue**: Function executes every minute (`*/1 * * * *`) with 120s timeout, creating potential for overlapping executions especially at midnight boundary.
**Solutions**:
- Implement robust execution locking with 90-second maximum lock duration (accounting for Appwrite's 14-minute force termination)
- Add midnight boundary detection to prevent day-transition conflicts
- Include execution time monitoring to detect potential overlap scenarios
- Add automatic backoff if previous execution detected as still running

### 8.2 Meeting Status Poller Midnight Boundary Handling
**Critical Issue**: Schedule `*/15 21-23,0-11 * * *` spans midnight (23:45 PM to 00:00 AM), with 300s timeout creating overlap risk.
**Solutions**:
- Implement day-transition aware execution locks (270-second maximum, accounting for Appwrite timeout)
- Add explicit midnight rollover logic in function execution
- Include validation to prevent duplicate processing across day boundaries
- Add graceful handling for functions that span midnight execution

### 8.3 Redundant Function Cleanup Eliminates Overlap Risk
**Resolution**: The `race-data-poller` function with problematic `*/10 * * * *` schedule and 840s timeout is being removed as redundant (Task 1), completely eliminating this major overlap risk.

## Implementation Priority

1. **High Priority**: Tasks 1-3 (Cleanup and separation)
2. **High Priority**: Task 8 (Critical CRON overlap resolution)
3. **Medium Priority**: Task 4 (Database setup optimization)
4. **Medium Priority**: Task 5 (Individual function robustness)
5. **Low Priority**: Tasks 6-7 (Best practices and monitoring)

## Expected Outcomes

- **Performance**: 40-60% reduction in function execution conflicts
- **Reliability**: 90%+ reduction in overlapping execution issues
- **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns with dedicated setup function
- **Monitoring**: Comprehensive logging and error handling for troubleshooting
- **Resource Efficiency**: Optimized CPU/memory usage based on function requirements

## Risk Mitigation

- All changes will be tested in development environment first
- Database setup function will be thoroughly validated before daily-meetings cleanup
- Execution locks include automatic cleanup to prevent deadlocks
- Rollback procedures documented for each major change
