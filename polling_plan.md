# Client Polling Implementation Plan - RaceDay v4.8

## Executive Summary

This document outlines the implementation strategy for a client-side polling system for the RaceDay single race page data updates. The polling strategy provides a predictable, controllable data update mechanism that follows server polling frequencies at a 2x rate to ensure optimal data freshness.

### Key Features

- **Client-side polling**: Follows server polling frequencies at 2x rate
- **Dynamic intervals**: Adjusts based on race timing and status
- **Coordinated fetching**: Single polling cycle for all data sources
- **Automatic termination**: Stops when race status transitions to `final`

---

## Polling Cadence Reference

The client polling strategy mirrors backend polling cadence but executes at **2× the backend frequency** until race status transitions to `final`:

| Backend Interval | Trigger Window                                | Required Client Interval | Notes                                                                                 |
| ---------------- | --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| 30 minutes       | Early open status baseline windows            | 15 minutes               | Ensures timeline has same minimum history coverage, twice as frequent as backend      |
| 2.5 minutes      | -20m to -5m race window                       | 75 seconds               | Maintain twice-the-frequency requirement while staying under 90s cap for UI freshness |
| 1 minute         | HTTP-triggered polls, fallback/recovery loops | 30 seconds               | Applies to fallback or recovery loops                                                 |
| 30 seconds       | Ultra-critical, critical, post-start windows  | 15 seconds               | Continue until race status becomes `final`; stop afterwards                           |

> **Note**: The client poll scheduler must tolerate backend optimizations (locks, skipped polls) by independently enforcing the client-side minimum cadence while avoiding request storms. Use race status, start time, and last successful fetch timestamps to adjust timers.

## Current Architecture Context

### Server Polling Patterns (Reference)

**Master Scheduler**: `/server/master-race-scheduler/src/main.js`

- Runs every 1 minute via CRON
- Coordinates high-frequency polling via enhanced-race-poller

**Dynamic Intervals Based on Race Timing:**

```
T-65m+: 5-minute intervals (baseline capture)
T-30m to T-5m: 1-minute intervals
T-5m to T-3m: 30-second intervals
T-3m to Start: 15-second intervals
Post-start: 15-second intervals until Final
```

### API Endpoints Available for Polling

- `/client/src/app/api/race/[id]/route.ts` - Race data
- `/client/src/app/api/race/[id]/money-flow-timeline/route.ts` - Money flow data
- `/client/src/app/api/race/[id]/pools/route.ts` - Pool data
- `/client/src/app/api/race/[id]/entrants/route.ts` - Entrants data

## Implementation Tasks

### Task 1: Create Client-Side Polling Infrastructure

**Status**: Completed
**Priority**: Critical
**Estimated Effort**: 10 hours

**Problem Statement**:
The client needs a centralized polling mechanism that can handle dynamic intervals based on race timing and status, following the specific cadence requirements.

**Task Details**:

1. **Create Core Polling Hook** (`/client/src/hooks/useRacePolling.ts`):

   ```typescript
   interface PollingConfig {
     raceId: string
     raceStartTime: string
     raceStatus: string
     initialData: RaceData
     onDataUpdate: (data: RaceData) => void
     onError: (error: Error) => void
   }

   export function useRacePolling(config: PollingConfig) {
     // Dynamic interval calculation based on cadence table
     // Polling state management
     // Error handling and retry logic
     // Automatic start after initial fetch success
     // Stop when race status becomes 'final'
   }
   ```

2. **Implement Cadence Calculator**:

   ```typescript
   function calculateClientPollingInterval(
     timeToStart: number,
     raceStatus: string
   ): number {
     // Backend 30m → Client 15m (900,000ms)
     if (timeToStart > 65) return 900000
     // Backend 2.5m → Client 75s (75,000ms)
     if (timeToStart > 5) return 75000
     // Backend 1m → Client 30s (30,000ms)
     if (timeToStart > 3) return 30000
     // Backend 30s → Client 15s (15,000ms)
     return 15000
   }
   ```

3. **Add Polling Lifecycle Management**:

   - Start polling only after `RaceContext.loadRaceData` resolves successfully
   - Active, paused, stopped states
   - Automatic stop when race status becomes `final` or `abandoned`
   - Background tab detection and optimization

4. **Implement Error Handling**:

**Task Details**:

1. **Create Precise Interval Calculation Logic**:

   ```typescript
   function calculatePollingInterval(
     timeToStart: number,
     raceStatus: string
   ): number {
     // Follow exact cadence table requirements
     if (timeToStart > 65) return 900000 // 15 minutes (backend: 30 min)
     if (timeToStart > 20) return 150000 // 2.5 minutes (backend: 5 min)
     if (timeToStart > 5) return 75000 // 75 seconds (backend: 2.5 min)
     if (timeToStart > 3) return 30000 // 30 seconds (backend: 1 min)
     if (timeToStart > 0) return 15000 // 15 seconds (backend: 30 sec)
     return raceStatus === 'final' ? 0 : 15000 // Stop if final, else continue
   }
   ```

     calculateBackoffDelay(): number {
       return Math.min(this.baseDelay * Math.pow(2, this.retryCount), 30000)
     }

     shouldRetry(error: Error): boolean {
       // Implement retry logic based on error type and status code
       // Don't retry on 4xx errors, do retry on 5xx and network errors
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Add Circuit Breaker Pattern**:

   - Stop polling after consecutive failures (5+ failed attempts)
